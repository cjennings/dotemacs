* Instructions

This inbox contains ONLY tasks that serve the V2MOM vision. Before adding any task here, ask:
1. Does it serve the Vision?
2. Does it align with the Values?
3. Is it addressed in the Methods?
4. Does it overcome an Obstacle?
5. Does it improve a Metric?

If the answer is "no" to all five → DON'T ADD IT.

V2MOM is located at: [[file:docs/emacs-config-v2mom.org][emacs-config-v2mom.org]]

* Method 1: Make Using Emacs Frictionless [7/13]

** DONE [#A] Remove network check from startup (saves 1+ seconds)
CLOSED: [2025-10-31 Fri]

✅ Deleted blocking ping check. Startup improved from 6.2s to 5.4s.
Now uses package priorities: .localrepo (200) > online repos (25).

** DONE [#A] Fix cj/goto-git-gutter-diff-hunks (missing function causing errors)
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Implemented missing function in modules/vc-config.el
- Added `cj/goto-git-gutter-diff-hunks` function (lines 118-124)
- Uses consult-line to search for diff markers (^[+\-])
- Enables interactive jumping to any changed line via C-; v d
- Function properly documented with docstring
- No linting issues, compiles cleanly

Quick win completed - 5 minutes actual time.

** DONE [#A] Fix chime-check throw with no catch block
CLOSED: [2025-11-01 Fri]

Error: "(no-catch --cl-block-chime-check-- nil)"
Chime was throwing to a catch block that doesn't exist.
Location: chime package - chime-check() function at line 1540
Fix: Changed defun to cl-defun to provide implicit catch block for cl-return-from.

Fixed in ~/code/chime.el/chime.el:1540

Added regression test: test-integration-startup-early-return-on-validation-failure
Created Makefile with test targets (unit, integration, all, by-file, by-name)
Updated README.org with Development/Testing section

All integration tests pass (5/5) ✅

** DONE [#A] Implement cj/diff-buffer-with-file (compare buffer with saved version)
CLOSED: [2025-10-31 Fri]

Bound to C-; b D. Weekly need satisfied.

** DONE [#B] Fix go-ts-mode-map keybinding error (void-variable)
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

Error: "Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable go-ts-mode-map)"
Location: modules/prog-go.el - trying to bind keys before mode loads.

✅ Already fixed in commit 196b289 (Nov 2, 2025)
- Moved keybinding from `:bind (:map go-ts-mode-map ...)` to hook function
- Keybinding now set in `cj/go-mode-keybindings` called via `:hook`
- Function executes after mode loads, ensuring keymap exists
- Today's cleanup: Removed unused forward declarations (lines 34-35)

Fix was: Wrap keybinding in hook function instead of :bind clause.
Result: No more void-variable error, keybinding works correctly.

** TODO [#B] Fix org-noter (reading/annotation workflow currently "so painful")

High priority - daily pain point.

** DONE [#B] Fix video/audio recording module (use constantly, just broke)
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

Main issue: No way to select audio devices when multiple are available.
Plugging in external audio interface broke recording - only captured input, not output.

✅ COMPLETED - Module now has robust device detection and selection.

*** DONE [#A] Add diagnostic command cj/recording-list-devices
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Created `cj/recording-list-devices` command (C-; r d)
Shows ALL available PulseAudio/PipeWire sources with drivers and states.
Displays current configuration.
Helps debug why auto-detection fails.

*** DONE [#A] Add device selection UI
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Created TWO selection workflows:
1. `cj/recording-select-devices` (C-; r s) - Full manual control
   - Select mic and system audio separately
   - Interactive completion with device states
2. `cj/recording-quick-setup-for-calls` (C-; r c) - Quick call setup
   - Smart device pairing (groups mic + monitor by hardware)
   - One selection for both mic and system audio
   - Handles Bluetooth MAC normalization

Devices cached in variables for future recordings.
Can switch devices without restarting Emacs.

*** DONE [#B] Improve error messages
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Error messages now include:
- Guidance to run `cj/recording-select-devices`
- Clear indication when auto-detection fails
- User-friendly prompts for manual selection

*** DONE [#B] Make device detection more flexible
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Implemented multi-level fallback system:
1. Auto-detect using pactl output parsing
2. Prompt user to select manually if auto-detect fails
3. Error with helpful guidance if user declines

✅ Smart device grouping in `cj/recording-group-devices-by-hardware`:
- Handles USB, PCI (built-in), and Bluetooth devices
- Normalizes Bluetooth MAC addresses (colons ↔ underscores)
- Assigns friendly names (e.g., "Built-in Laptop Audio", "Bluetooth Headset")
- Filters incomplete devices (must have both mic and monitor)

✅ Supports both PulseAudio and PipeWire (both use pactl).

*** TODO [#B] Validate recording startup
Check process status after starting.
Parse ffmpeg output for errors.
Show actual ffmpeg command for debugging.

** DONE [#A] Add comprehensive test coverage for video-audio-recording module
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Created comprehensive test suite following quality-engineer.org standards:
- 9 test files (8 unit + 1 integration)
- 83 test cases with 100% pass rate
- Test categories: Normal, Boundary, Error cases
- 6 test fixtures for reproducible testing
- Mocking strategy using cl-letf
- Integration test validates complete parse→group→friendly-names workflow
- Tests document bugs in legacy detect functions
- Critical validation: Bluetooth MAC normalization across component boundaries

✅ Refactored code for testability:
- Extracted `cj/recording--parse-pactl-output` internal parser
- Separated I/O from business logic

✅ Fixed all linting warnings (checkdoc):
- 6 spacing/grammar issues resolved
- `make lint` now passes cleanly

✅ All changes committed and pushed to all remotes (origin + github)

Commits:
- 0a69c58: test: Add comprehensive test suite for video-audio-recording module
- b086539: style: Fix checkdoc warnings in video-audio-recording.el

*** TODO [#C] Add device testing command cj/recording-test-devices
Records 3 seconds of audio.
Plays it back.
Confirms devices work before real recording.

*** TODO [#C] Add recording status display (optional via flag, default off)
Show "Recording: 00:05:23" in modeline or echo area.
Timer showing duration.
File size updating.

*** TODO [#C] Add recording presets
Screencast (video + audio, high quality).
Podcast (audio only, voice optimized).
Meeting (balanced, lower filesize).
Quick note (audio, low quality, small file).

*** TODO [#C] Build recording history buffer
*Recordings* buffer showing history.
Duration, file size, location.
Quick actions: play, delete, rename, move.

*** TODO [#C] Add post-processing hooks
Auto-compress after recording.
Move to cloud sync directory.
Generate transcript (once transcription workflow exists).

** TODO [#B] Fix mail attachment workflow (currently awkward)

Daily workflow improvement.

** TODO [#B] Optimize org-agenda performance using built-in profiler

THE BOTTLENECK. Currently 30+ seconds, target < 5 seconds.
Use M-x profiler-start before Method 3 debug-profiling.el is built.

** TODO [#B] Optimize org-capture target building performance

15-20 seconds every time capturing a task (12+ times/day).
Major daily bottleneck - minutes lost waiting, plus context switching cost.

** TODO [#C] Fix grammar checker performance (currently disabled)

Currently disabled because it breaks flow when writing.

** TODO [#D] Fix EMMS keybinding inconsistency with other buffers

EMMS keybindings conflict with standard buffer keybindings, causing mistypes.
Results in accidental destructive actions (clearing buffers), requires undo + context switch.
Violates Intuitive value - muscle memory should help, not hurt.

* Method 2: Stop Problems Before They Appear [2/5]

** TODO [#B] Migrate from Company to Corfu
:PROPERTIES:
:COMPLETE_CONFIG: [[file:docs/someday-maybe.org::1611][todo.org:1611-1639]]
:END:

Complete config already exists in someday-maybe.org. Just needs to be executed.

** DONE [#C] Switch to mood-line
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Replaced doom-modeline with mood-line in modules/modeline-config.el
- Simplified from 70+ lines to ~10 lines of configuration
- mood-line is lightweight, minimal, inspired by doom-modeline
- Better performance with no dependencies
- Features: buffer status, major mode, VCS, flycheck, cursor position
- Net reduction: -40 lines of configuration code

** DONE [#C] Remove deprecated tree-sitter package (rely on treesit-auto)
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Removed deprecated tree-sitter package from modules/prog-general.el
- Deleted `(use-package tree-sitter)` on line 97
- Now relies solely on Emacs 29+ built-in treesit with treesit-auto
- treesit-auto continues to manage tree-sitter grammars automatically
- No functionality lost, cleaner dependency tree

** TODO [#C] Add org-appear (show emphasis markers only when point is on them)

Cleaner org files, supports Intuitive value.

** TODO [#C] Integrate prescient with Corfu (smart sorting)

Already using prescient with vertico. Extend to Corfu after migration.

* Method 3: Make *Fixing* Emacs Frictionless [0/5]

** TODO [#B] Build debug-profiling.el module

Reusable profiling infrastructure for any future performance work.

** TODO [#C] Document localrepo limitations (treesitter grammars not included)

.localrepo only contains packages from package.el archives.
Treesitter grammars are downloaded separately by treesit-auto on first use.
For true offline reproducibility, need to cache treesitter grammars separately.

** TODO [#C] Integrate Buttercup (behavior-driven integration tests)

Complex workflow testing capability.

** TODO [#C] Build localrepo out (package snapshot system)

Repeatable installs and safe rollbacks.

** DONE [#C] Integrate difftastic (structural diffs)
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

✅ Completed difftastic integration:
1. **Upgraded cj/diff-buffer-with-file to use ediff** (modules/custom-buffer-file.el)
   - Replaced basic unified diff with ediff-current-file
   - Now uses same ediff config (horizontal split, j/k navigation)
   - Keybinding C-; b D now launches interactive ediff

2. **Added difftastic for git diffs** (modules/vc-config.el)
   - Installed binary: difftastic 0.64.0
   - Added difftastic.el package integrated with magit
   - Keybindings in magit-diff: D for dwim, S for show
   - Provides structural, language-aware diffs for git changes

Result: Better diffs everywhere - ediff for interactive buffer comparison,
difftastic for understanding git changes.

* Method 4: Contribute to the Emacs Ecosystem [0/4]

** TODO [#C] Set up package-lint for elisp linting (chime, org-msg, wttrin)

Catch packaging issues automatically.

** TODO [#C] Set up melpazoid CI for MELPA submissions

Validates packages meet MELPA standards.

** TODO [#C] Set up elisp-check GitHub Action
