*** Mu4e - Save All Attachments Testing
It's pretty easy if you use vertico + embark.
After running mu4e-view-save-attachments,
- invoke embark-act-all in the completion menu
- followed by RET (mu4e-view-save-attachments) to save all attachments,
- or TAB (vertico-insert) followed by (comma) next to each file you want to save,
- then RET (vertico-exit), to save selected attachments.

** DOING [#B] Implement Performance Recommendations                   :bug:
*** Lazy-load configuration modules                      :complex4:impact5:
Loading every module with `require` forces all code and packages to initialize during startup. Switching to `use-package` with `:defer` or `:commands` loads modules only when their functionality is invoked, greatly reducing startup time.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dirvish-config
    :load-path "modules"
    :commands (dirvish dirvish-side))
#+end_src
*** DONE Defer Dashboard initialization                  :complex2:impact4:
CLOSED: [2025-09-08 Mon 14:09]
The dashboard package is loaded eagerly via `:demand`, adding a noticeable delay. Load it after startup and open it on the first idle event instead.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dashboard
    :defer t
    :hook (emacs-startup . dashboard-open))
#+end_src
*** CANCELLED Replace synchronous network ping with non-blocking check :complex3:impact2:
CLOSED: [2025-09-08 Mon 16:07]
- State "CANCELLED"  from              [2025-09-08 Mon 16:07]
`internet-up-p` spawns a blocking `ping` process at startup. Using `make-network-process` avoids shelling out and lets the check run asynchronously.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun internet-up-p (&optional host)
    "Non-blocking network availability check."
    (make-network-process
     :name "net-check" :host (or host "www.google.com") :service 80
     :sentinel (lambda (proc _)
                 (setq cj/network-available (eq (process-status proc) 'open))
                 (delete-process proc))))
#+end_src

This actually added 15 seconds to the launch time.
*** Postpone package refreshing to idle time             :complex1:impact3:
Refreshing ELPA archives during startup adds I/O overhead. Defer this check to an idle timer so it runs after Emacs is ready.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
            (lambda () (run-with-idle-timer 60 nil #'package-refresh-contents)))
#+end_src

*** Enable package quickstart caching                    :complex1:impact2:
Precomputing autoloads with package quickstart reduces the cost of loading package code.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq package-quickstart t)
  (package-quickstart-refresh)
#+end_src

*** Byte-compile configuration files                     :complex1:impact2:
Byte-compiled Emacs Lisp loads faster than source. Recompile the configuration directory when changes are made.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (byte-recompile-directory user-emacs-directory 0)
#+end_src

*** Manage garbage collection with GCMH                  :complex1:impact2:
After startup, `gcmh` dynamically adjusts GC thresholds to minimize pauses without manual tuning.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package gcmh
    :hook (after-init . gcmh-mode)
    :config

** TODO [#B] Add All ERT Tests Into Separate Directory                :bug:
*** 2025-09-13 Sat @ 12:18:26 -0500 Gave this task to Codex
Move all ERT tests out of individual files in the modules directories, and move them all to files in the test directories. The files should be named after the functions they test.  Move existing ERT tests in the test directories to these files as well, removing those original test files. Provide another elisp file that will read all ERT files, and offer to run all the ERT tests in that file, or all ERT tests from all the files.
*** Goals
Tests should be added to a separate directory rather than the end of each elisp file.
Gather them together, move them there, and make it easy to run tests per module and workflow.

*** 2025-06-03 Tue @ 15:12:51 -0500 Problem
Emacs Alarm seems to sound off periodically after the alarm rang the first time.
It should ring once at the beginning of the event, and that's it.
*** 2025-06-28 Sat @ 12:42:19 -0500 User's Method for Alarms In Emacs
This is more than I actually want, but leaving here for reference.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I am quite happy with the system I use, which does (I think) exactly what you want. It has two parts: an Emacs part that uses appt.el to schedule the reminders and a small shell program (I'm using Linux) that creates the popup + sound notification. Here I share the code for both parts.
A) Code in ~/.emacs.d/init.el
(require 'appt)
(appt-activate t)
(setq appt-message-warning-time 5) ; Show notification 5 minutes before event
(setq appt-display-interval appt-message-warning-time) ; Disable multiple reminders
(setq appt-display-mode-line nil)
; Use appointment data from org-mode
(defun my-org-agenda-to-appt ()
(interactive)
(setq appt-time-msg-list nil)
(org-agenda-to-appt))
; Update alarms when...
; (1) ... Starting Emacs
(my-org-agenda-to-appt)
; (2) ... Everyday at 12:05am (useful in case you keep Emacs always on)
(run-at-time "12:05am" (* 24 3600) 'my-org-agenda-to-appt)
; (3) ... When TODO.txt is saved
(add-hook 'after-save-hook
'(lambda ()
(if (string= (buffer-file-name) (concat (getenv "HOME") "/ideas/TODO.txt"))
(my-org-agenda-to-appt))))
; Display appointments as a window manager notification
(setq appt-disp-window-function 'my-appt-display)
(setq appt-delete-window-function (lambda () t))
(setq my-appt-notification-app (concat (getenv "HOME") "/bin/appt-notification"))
(defun my-appt-display (min-to-app new-time msg)
(if (atom min-to-app)
(start-process "my-appt-notification-app" nil my-appt-notification-app min-to-app msg)
(dolist (i (number-sequence 0 (1- (length min-to-app))))
(start-process "my-appt-notification-app" nil my-appt-notification-app (nth i min-to-app) (nth i msg)))))

(;;B) Code in ~/bin/appt-notification
#!/bin/sh
TIME="$1"
MSG="$2"
notify-send -t 0 "<br>Appointment in $TIME minutes:<br>$MSG<br>"
play "~/bin/alarm.wav"
To get voice notifications you could replace the last line (play) with the following:
espeak "Appointment in $TIME minutes: $MSG"

*** 2025-09-02 Tue @ 14:06:03 -0500 Functionality Description
Tentative Package Name: Jumper
I typically use registers to jump between places, but I often forget the keybindings. Also, I sometimes overwrite registers by hitting the wrong key. Many Emacs users  don't even know about registers. I've seen posts from software developers asking how to conveniently store and jump to specific locations in a large code base.
To solve this I'd like to write a little elisp package that leverages Emacs vanilla register functionality to make jumping between locations using registers simple and transparent. The user won't have to think about registers or what character they've stored their location in at all. All keybindings will be based on keys from home row of the keyboard.
Preliminaries:
We will map the functionality to the keybinding prefix C-; j, but the prefix should be easy to configure.
Let's imagine a set of characters in a sequence. They could be any characters, but for the sake of simplicity we'll use the numbers from 0 to 9, and a one more character used for the "last location" -- the character "z".
What follows is a description of the workflow:
**** Adding Locations
keybinding: <prefix> space (store destination)
If the user is visiting a buffer and presses <prefix> space,
- the current location is stored in the next free register. if this is the first time they are storing a location, the first free register is 0.
user feedback: a message is displayed in the echo area saying "location stored."
If the user stays on the same location and presses prefix <space> again, they should receive a message in the echo area saying the location is already stored, and no changes to the register is made.
If the user moves to a new location and presses prefix <space> again, the next free register is used to store the location, in this case it would be 1. They can then iterate and store additional locations up to the last character in the sequence up to the limit of 10 registers (0 through 9). If they try to store a register after all 10 registers are filled, they will receive a message ("sorry - all jump locations are filled!").
**** Jump-To A Location
keybinding: <prefix> j (jump to destination)
NOTE: Whenever the user presses <prefix> j, that location is automatically stored in the "last location" register z.
***** When only one location is stored, and the user presses <prefix> j:
If there is only one location stored, the user IS at the location, and they press <prefix> j, they see an echo area message "you're already at the stored location."
If there is only one location stored in the sequence, and the user is NOT at that location, their location is stored in register z, then the user is immediately to their destination location via (jump-to-register).
user feedback: a message is displayed in the echo area saying "jumped to location."
If the user presses <prefix> J again, they are automatically taken back to the location in register z. and the same user feedback message is displayed.
In other words, after the user stores one location and moves elsewhere, pressing <prefix> j will jump back and forth between the two places.
***** When multiple locations are stored, and the user presses <prefix> j:
A completing read is displayed with all the locations between 0 and 9 along with register z (their last location) at the bottom.
Each line contains the letter as well as the content that the register would normally display. In other words, it could just be the register list is displayed, but narrowed down to 0 - 9 and z.
When the user chooses a location 0 -9, z from completing read:
- The current location is stored in register z, replacing their last location
- They are taken to the location via (jump-to-register).
user feedback: a message is displayed in the echo area saying "jumped to location."
**** Removing Locations
keybinding: <prefix> d
A completing read is displayed with the first item (where the cursor is on) being "Cancel".
The rest of the registers are displayed in descending order, i.e., from 9 to 0.
Note: the z register is not displayed.
Selecting a register from the list:
- removes that item from the list, and removes the location stored in the register.
- if the item is NOT the top one in the register, it reorders the rest of the sequence
  in other words, if 0 - 9 are all stored, and:
  the user removes item 7:
  - location 8 is restored in 7
  - location 9 is stored in 8
  the user removes item 0
  - location 1 is stored in 0
  - location 2 is stored in 1
  - location 3 is stored in 2
  - location 4 is stored in 3
  - location 5 is stored in 4
  - location 6 is stored in 5
  - location 7 is stored in 6
  - location 8 is stored in 7
  - location 9 is stored in 8
user feedback: a message is displayed in the echo area saying "location removed."
**** Open Questions
- Are there buffers which the user should not be able to store in a register?
- How can we prevent the user from creating issues by adding to the registers 0 through 9 by M-x point-to-register or it's keybinding? Is there a way to block or reserve those registers? Or is it better to just choose a sequence that is the least likely to be used by a human user? If so, what would that sequence be?
- Is 10 registers enough for a normal developer?
- I should probably
- Can I use a vector/list internally and map to registers behind the scenes?
Depending on context, can I add the
- Function name at point
- File name + line number
- First few words of the line
Do we think the reordering behavior when deleting locations might confuse users? How to simplify?
What happens if a buffer is deleted that doesn't have a file associated with it? If we're using registers underneath, how do registers handle this?
** TODO [#B] Get Tufte.css working and as a separate entry
Below is one way to get Org-mode’s HTML exporter to play nicely with Tufte-CSS.  The basic recipe is:
1. Inject Tufte’s stylesheet into every HTML export
2. Teach Org to emit the little “margin-toggle” + “sidenote” markup that tufte.css expects for footnotes
3. (Optionally) wrap images in <figure> so you get tufte-style captions out of the box
Along the way you’ll see where Org’s default HTML‐classes line up with tufte.css and where you have to override them.
— 1 Inject tufte.css into your exports
Put tufte.css somewhere your exported HTML can see it (for example
~/.emacs.d/assets/tufte.css or a URL on your webserver).  Then in your init.el:
(with-eval-after-load 'ox-html
;; 1a) tell Org to link in your tufte.css
(setq org-html-head-extra
"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/assets/tufte.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>")
;; 1b) enable HTML5 “fancy” output (so you get <figure> around images)
(setq org-html-html5-fancy t
org-html-inline-images  t))
— 2 Turn Org footnotes into Tufte sidenotes
By default Org emits
<sup class=…><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">[1]</a></sup>
…and then a big =<div id="footnotes">= at the bottom.
Tufte-CSS wants each footnote inline, wrapped in
<label class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">…your note…</span>
We can override two Org variables:
(with-eval-after-load 'ox-html
;; format of each inline footnote reference
(setq org-html-footnote-format
(concat
"<label for=\"%1$s\" class=\"margin-toggle\">"
"&#8853;</label>"
"<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"%1$s\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/>"
"<span class=\"sidenote\">%2$s</span>"))
;; drop Org’s default footnote list at the end
(setq org-html-footnote-separator ""))
Once you do that, exporting an Org file with footnotes will generate the markup tufte.css needs to float them in the margin.
— 3 (Optionally) get <figure> + <figcaption> around images
If you set =org-html-html5-fancy= to t (see step 1) Org will automatically emit:
<figure>
<img src="…"/>
<figcaption>Your caption</figcaption>
</figure>
and tufte.css already has rules for =<figure class="figure">= etc.
— 4 Common pitfalls
• Make sure your href in =org-html-head-extra= actually points to the css that the browser can load (absolute vs. relative).
• If you still see a “Footnotes” section at the bottom, double-check that =org-html-footnote-separator= is set to the empty string and that your init-file got re-evaluated.
• On Windows or if you’re testing locally, run e.g. =python3 -m http.server= inside your export folder so your browser can fetch the CSS.
— 5 Unit test for your footnote hack
Drop this in =~/.emacs.d/tests/test-org-tufte.el= and run =M-x ert RET t RET=:
(require 'ert)
;; load your config; adjust the path if necessary
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
(ert-deftest org-tufte-footnote-format-test ()
"Ensure each footnote reference becomes a margin-toggle + sidenote."
(let/ ((id      "fn:42")
(content "My note.")
(html    (format org-html-footnote-format id content)))
(should (string-match-p "class=\"margin-toggle\"" html))
(should (string-match-p "<span class=\"sidenote\">My note\\.</span>" html))
;; it must not accidentally reintroduce Org’s bottom-of-page footnote div
(should-not (string-match-p "div id=\"footnotes\"" html))))
Once that test passes, you know your footnotes are being rewritten into Tufte-style side notes.  From there, you can sprinkle in additional filters (e.g. wrap =<blockquote>= in a =.sidenote= class, override list/p table styles, etc.) or just let the rest of tufte.css style Org’s default tags (h1, p, ul, table, code, etc.).
Enjoy your beautifully-typeset Org → HTML exports in true Tufte style!

** TODO [#C] Emacs Change Appropriate Use-package Installs to :vc
especially where you're cloning them to provide fixes
** TODO [#C] Emacs Config: Narrowing Org doesn't allow refresh by type
After generating an org agenda list, I can narrow the type to all DONE or IN-PROGRESS. However when I use my custom functions to just get the agenda for the current buffer, I can't. The scope has now widened and the refresh is for all buffers.
** TODO [#C] Add a Restrict to Subtree Org Agenda Command
In Org-mode the “agenda” machinery by default doesn’t pay any attention to your buffer­narrow — it always scans whole files in your =org-agenda-files=.  However, you can teach Org-agenda to only look between two points (the start and end of your current subtree) by using the built-in “restrict” hooks:
1.  =org‐agenda‐restrict=         – turn on restriction
2.  =org‐agenda‐restrict‐begin=  – a marker or position where scanning begins
3.  =org‐agenda‐restrict‐end=    – where it ends
4.  (optionally) set =org-agenda-files= to just your current file
Here is a drop-in =org-agenda-custom-commands= entry that will give you a “Subtree TODOs” view limited to the subtree you’re on.  Put this in your Emacs init:
#+begin_src  emacs-lisp
  ;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
  ;; 1) Define a custom agenda command "C" (hit C-c a C)
  ;;    that shows only TODO entries in the current subtree.
  ;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
  (with-eval-after-load 'org
    (add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
                 '("C"                                ; the key you press after C-c a
                   "Subtree TODOs"                   ; a descriptive name
                   ((todo ""                         ; match any TODO keyword
                          ;; === per-block settings ===
                          ;; only look in this file
                          (org-agenda-files (list buffer-file-name))
                          ;; enable the restriction engine
                          (org-agenda-restrict t)
                          ;; start at the top of the current heading
                          (org-agenda-restrict-begin
                           (progn (org-back-to-heading t) (point)))
                          ;; end at the end of this subtree
                          (org-agenda-restrict-end
                           (progn (org-end-of-subtree t) (point))))
                    ;; you can add more blocks here if you like
                    ))))
#+end_src
How this works, step by step:
• We bind a new custom command under the key “C” (so you’ll type =C-c a C=).
• In that command we use the =todo= matcher =""= to catch every headline whose state is one of your TODO keywords.
• We dynamically set
– =org-agenda-files= to just the current buffer’s file,
– =org-agenda-restrict= to non-nil so Org will honor the begin/end markers,
– =org-agenda-restrict-begin= to the position of the current heading,
– =org-agenda-restrict-end= to the end of the subtree.
When you invoke it (=C-c a C=), Org will only scan headlines in that slice of the file and will build you a mini-agenda of TODO items from exactly that subtree.
Quick alternative: if you don’t need the full agenda machinery (dates, deadlines, etc.) but just want a fast outline of your TODOs under the current heading, you can also use the sparse-tree command:
• =C-c / t=  ⇒ shows only the TODO headings in the narrowed or whole buffer as an indented outline.
— Tips & Pitfalls —
• Make sure your file is saved and in =org-agenda-files= (the snippet above forces it).
• Remember to call =org-narrow-to-subtree= (or let the command compute its own begin/end via =org-back-to-heading=/=org-end-of-subtree=).
• If you rename or move your file, Emacs must still see =buffer-file-name= valid.
• You can duplicate the above snippet for other TODO states, agenda views, or matchers (deadlines, tags, etc.)
With this in place you effectively get an agenda tailored to exactly the bit of tree you’re working on.

** TODO [#B] Get Dupre Theme Working                                   :bug:
*** AI Suggestioms
Here are some ideas for making dupre-theme a bit more “complete” and future-proof as an Emacs theme.  You don’t have to do all of them, of course, but most “modern” themes ship a fair number of these extra faces and integrations.
**** TODO [#A] Fill out the “standard” Emacs faces
• error / warning / success
• link / link-visited / shadow
• highlight / secondary-selection
• tooltip / tooltip-selection / tooltip-tip
• underline / strike-through
• match / search / lazy-highlight (you already have some isearch)
• info-title-1…info-title-5, info-header-node, help-*-face
**** TODO [#A] Cosmetic / code-style notes
• Factor out a helper macro to reduce repetition:
#+begin_src elisp
  (defmacro dupre-face (face &rest specs)
    `(,face ((t ,specs))))
#+end_src
• Use =custom-theme-set-faces= only once; wrap your =when (>= emacs-major-version…)= inside it rather than nesting top-level.
• Move your ERT tests into a separate file like =dupre-theme-test.el= so that the main theme file stays lean.
**** TODO [#B] Make sure you define a “minimum package” set of faces so that folks don’t see glaring unstyled text in any part of Emacs, even if they never install extra packages.
**** TODO [#B] Improve terminal support:
• Detect true-color (=(display-graphic-p)=) vs 256-color vs 16-color and fall-back gracefully.
• Provide “256-color” approximations (you already do this), but you might want a simpler palette for legacy terminals.
**** TODO [#B] Other Packages
The rest is just more of the same—pick the most common modes/packages you and your users rely on and give them a quick coat of paint.  Once you’ve rounded out those faces you’ll have hit what most people expect from a “complete” modern Emacs theme.
Based on a quick skim of your modules/ directory (and the packages they pull in via use-package), here’s a non-exhaustive list of the major packages you’re using—along with the faces you should think about adding to dupre-theme so that nothing ends up looking “unstyled.”
1. completion/mini-frameworks
   • vertico (vertico-current, vertico-group-title, vertico-separator, vertico-doc)
   • orderless (orderless-match-face-0…3)
   • consult (consult-preview-line, consult-narrow, consult-region, consult-file)
   • marginalia (marginalia-annotation, marginalia-document, marginalia-cache)
   • embark (embark-general, embark-heading, embark-target, embark-helpful)
   • corfu + cape (corfu-default, corfu-current, corfu-bar, cape-file, cape-keyword etc.)
   • company (company-tooltip, company-tooltip-selection, company-scrollbar­-thumb)
2. ivy/counsel/swiper (if you ever load them side-by-side)
   • ivy-current-match, ivy-minibuffer-match-face-1…4
   • counsel-outline, swiper-match-face-1…
3. syntax checkers & LSP
   • flycheck (flycheck-error, flycheck-warning, flycheck-info)
   • eglot or lsp-mode (lsp-face-highlight-textual, lsp-face-highlight-read, lsp-face-semantic-type-…)
   • tree-sitter (tree-sitter-hl-face:function, :variable, :property, …)
4. git & diffs
   • magit (magit-section, magit-section-title, magit-hunk-heading, magit-branch, magit-log)
   • diff-hl / git-gutter (diff-hl-face-insert, diff-hl-face-delete, git-gutter:added, git-gutter:deleted)
   • diff-mode (diff-added, diff-removed, diff-context, diff-file-header)
5. project management & navigation
   • projectile (projectile-project-name, projectile-project-root)
   • treemacs (treemacs-root-face, treemacs-directory-face, treemacs-file-face)
6. Org-mode
   • org-document-title, org-level-1…org-level-8
   • org-checkbox, org-todo, org-done, org-warning, org-date, org-code, org-block
   • plus any “pretty” add-ons you use (org-bullets, org-modern, etc.)
7. Hydra / which-key / key-help
   • which-key (which-key-key-face, which-key-group-description-face, which-key-local-map-description-face)
   • hydra (hydra-face-red, hydra-face-blue, hydra-face-teal, hydra-face-amaranth)
8. visual helpers
   • rainbow-delimiters-depth-1…9
   • highlight-indent-guides-odd/even
   • highlight-parentheses-/
   • beacon (beacon), whitespace (whitespace-space, whitespace-tab, whitespace-newline)
   • display-line-numbers (line-number, line-number-current-line—you already have these)
9. UI polishers
   • all-the-icons (all-the-icons-blue, all-the-icons-red, …) on modeline or treemacs
   • doom-modeline (doom-modeline-bar, doom-modeline-buffer-path)
   • fancy-splash/dashboard-faces if you use a startup screen
10. terminals & shells
    • vterm (vterm-copy-region-highlight)
    • ansi-colors (ansi-color-face-bold, ansi-color-face-italic, ansi-color-[0…7])
To figure out exactly which ones you have in your modules, you can do for example:
#+begin_src elisp
  ;; from your ~/.emacs.d
  (let (pkgs)
    (dolist (f (directory-files "~/.emacs.d/modules" t "\\.el$"))

Then for each of those packages, grep in their repo for =defface= or check their manual to see which faces they define, and add reasonable dupre-colours for them. Once you’ve covered that list, you’ll have a “complete” theme that won’t leave any of your modules half-unstyled.
**** TODO [#C] Support the built-in “tab-bar” and “tab-group” faces (Emacs 27+)
• tab-bar              / tab-bar-tab / tab-bar-tab-inactive
• tab-bar-close        / tab-bar-separator
• tab-group-title      / tab-group-separator
**** TODO [#C] Add faces for =dired=, =diff=, =flycheck=/=flymake=, =magit= (or git-gutter),
=ediff=, =erc= etc.  For example:
• diff-added, diff-removed, diff-context, diff-file-header
• flycheck-error, flycheck-warning, flycheck-info
• magit-section, magit-log, magit-hunk-heading, magit-branch, etc.
**** TODO [#C] Org-mode
• org-level-1…org-level-8, org-document-title
• org-checkbox, org-code, org-date, org-todo, org-done, org-warning
• org-block, org-block-begin-line, org-block-end-line
**** TODO [#C] Completion frameworks & minibuffer enhancements
• ivy-current-match / ivy-minibuffer-match-face-1…4
• swiper-line-face
• vertico-current / marginalia-…
• corfu-default / corfu-bar / cape / orderless-match-face-…
**** TODO [#C] LSP / tree-sitter / syntax-aware faces
• lsp-face-highlight-textual, lsp-face-highlight-read, etc.
• tree-sitter-hl-face:variable, :function, :property, etc.
**** TODO [#C] Which-Key, Hydras, rainbow-delimiters, etc.
• which-key-key-face, which-key-local-map-description-face
• hydra-face-red / teal / blue
• rainbow-delimiters-depth-1…9
**** TODO [#C] Theme Metadata & Packaging
• Add =;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1"))= if you need a minimum.
• Consider adding a README with screenshots.
• A simple Makefile or script to refresh “theme metadata” (=M-x theme-inspect=, MELPA recipe).
**** TODO [#C] Tests
• Extend your ERT suite to cover more faces (org, diff, flycheck…).
• You might write a small helper that loops over a list of faces and asserts they’re defined without errors.
**** Example Sample Faces
Below is a small excerpt showing how you might start adding some of the “missing” standard faces and a couple org faces:
#+begin_src elisp
  (custom-theme-set-faces
   'dupre
   ;; … your existing faces …
   ;; standard global faces
   `(error   ((t (:foreground ,dupre-intense-red :weight bold))))
   `(warning ((t (:foreground ,dupre-yellow+1 :weight bold))))
   `(success ((t (:foreground ,dupre-green+1 :weight bold))))
   `(link    ((t (:foreground ,dupre-blue+1 :underline t))))
   `(shadow  ((t (:foreground ,dupre-gray))))
   `(highlight ((t (:background ,dupre-bg+1))))
   `(tooltip ((t (:foreground ,dupre-fg :background ,dupre-bg+2))))
   `(tooltip-selection ((t (:background ,dupre-bg+0))))
   ;; Org-mode sample
   `(org-document-title       ((t (:foreground ,dupre-yellow+2 :weight bold :height 1.2))))
   `(org-level-1              ((t (:foreground ,dupre-blue+2 :weight bold))))
   `(org-level-2              ((t (:foreground ,dupre-green+1))))
   `(org-checkbox             ((t (:foreground ,dupre-yellow :weight bold))))
   `(org-todo                 ((t (:foreground ,dupre-red :weight bold))))
   `(org-done                 ((t (:foreground ,dupre-green+2 :weight bold))))
   )
