* Instructions

This inbox contains ONLY tasks that serve the V2MOM vision. Before adding any task here, ask:
1. Does it serve the Vision?
2. Does it align with the Values?
3. Is it addressed in the Methods?
4. Does it overcome an Obstacle?
5. Does it improve a Metric?

If the answer is "no" to all five → DON'T ADD IT.

V2MOM is located at: [[file:docs/emacs-config-v2mom.org][emacs-config-v2mom.org]]

* Method 1: Make Using Emacs Frictionless
** DONE [#A] Remove network check from startup (saves 1+ seconds)
CLOSED: [2025-10-31 Fri]

✅ Deleted blocking ping check. Startup improved from 6.2s to 5.4s.
Now uses package priorities: .localrepo (200) > online repos (25).

** TODO [#A] Fix cj/goto-git-gutter-diff-hunks (missing function causing errors)

Quick win - 15 minutes. Just needs to be defined.

** DONE [#A] Fix chime-check throw with no catch block
CLOSED: [2025-11-01 Fri]

Error: "(no-catch --cl-block-chime-check-- nil)"
Chime was throwing to a catch block that doesn't exist.
Location: chime package - chime-check() function at line 1540
Fix: Changed defun to cl-defun to provide implicit catch block for cl-return-from.

Fixed in ~/code/chime.el/chime.el:1540

Added regression test: test-integration-startup-early-return-on-validation-failure
Created Makefile with test targets (unit, integration, all, by-file, by-name)
Updated README.org with Development/Testing section

All integration tests pass (5/5) ✅

** DONE [#A] Implement cj/diff-buffer-with-file (compare buffer with saved version)
CLOSED: [2025-10-31 Fri]

Bound to C-; b D. Weekly need satisfied.

** TODO [#B] Fix go-ts-mode-map keybinding error (void-variable)

Error: "Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-variable go-ts-mode-map)"
Location: modules/prog-go.el - trying to bind keys before mode loads.
Fix: Wrap keybinding in with-eval-after-load or check if variable is bound.

** TODO [#B] Fix org-noter (reading/annotation workflow currently "so painful")

High priority - daily pain point.

** TODO [#B] Fix video/audio recording module (use constantly, just broke)

Main issue: No way to select audio devices when multiple are available.
Plugging in external audio interface broke recording - only captured input, not output.

Use constantly, needs to work reliably.

*** TODO [#A] Add diagnostic command cj/recording-list-devices
Show ALL available PulseAudio/PipeWire sources.
Helps debug why auto-detection fails.
User can copy device names if needed.

*** TODO [#A] Add device selection UI
Prompt user to select mic and system audio sources.
Cache selected devices for future recordings.
Allow switching devices without restarting Emacs.

*** TODO [#B] Improve error messages
Show which devices were found/not found.
Include actual pactl output in error messages.
Suggest manual device configuration.

*** TODO [#B] Make device detection more flexible
Try multiple regex patterns for different audio setups.
Fallback to prompting user to select from list.
Support both PulseAudio and PipeWire.

*** TODO [#B] Validate recording startup
Check process status after starting.
Parse ffmpeg output for errors.
Show actual ffmpeg command for debugging.

*** TODO [#C] Add device testing command cj/recording-test-devices
Records 3 seconds of audio.
Plays it back.
Confirms devices work before real recording.

*** TODO [#C] Add recording status display (optional via flag, default off)
Show "Recording: 00:05:23" in modeline or echo area.
Timer showing duration.
File size updating.

*** TODO [#C] Add recording presets
Screencast (video + audio, high quality).
Podcast (audio only, voice optimized).
Meeting (balanced, lower filesize).
Quick note (audio, low quality, small file).

*** TODO [#C] Build recording history buffer
*Recordings* buffer showing history.
Duration, file size, location.
Quick actions: play, delete, rename, move.

*** TODO [#C] Add post-processing hooks
Auto-compress after recording.
Move to cloud sync directory.
Generate transcript (once transcription workflow exists).

** TODO [#B] Fix mail attachment workflow (currently awkward)

Daily workflow improvement.

** TODO [#B] Optimize org-agenda performance using built-in profiler

THE BOTTLENECK. Currently 30+ seconds, target < 5 seconds.
Use M-x profiler-start before Method 3 debug-profiling.el is built.

** TODO [#B] Optimize org-capture target building performance

15-20 seconds every time capturing a task (12+ times/day).
Major daily bottleneck - minutes lost waiting, plus context switching cost.

** TODO [#C] Fix grammar checker performance (currently disabled)

Currently disabled because it breaks flow when writing.

** TODO [#D] Fix EMMS keybinding inconsistency with other buffers

EMMS keybindings conflict with standard buffer keybindings, causing mistypes.
Results in accidental destructive actions (clearing buffers), requires undo + context switch.
Violates Intuitive value - muscle memory should help, not hurt.

* Method 2: Stop Problems Before They Appear

** TODO [#B] Migrate from Company to Corfu
:PROPERTIES:
:COMPLETE_CONFIG: [[file:docs/someday-maybe.org::1611][todo.org:1611-1639]]
:END:

Complete config already exists in someday-maybe.org. Just needs to be executed.

** TODO [#C] Switch to mood-line

Already researched. Lighter modeline.

** TODO [#C] Remove deprecated tree-sitter package (rely on treesit-auto)

Already have treesit-auto installed. Just remove old package.

** TODO [#C] Add org-appear (show emphasis markers only when point is on them)

Cleaner org files, supports Intuitive value.

** TODO [#C] Integrate prescient with Corfu (smart sorting)

Already using prescient with vertico. Extend to Corfu after migration.

* Method 3: Make *Fixing* Emacs Frictionless

** TODO [#B] Build debug-profiling.el module

Reusable profiling infrastructure for any future performance work.

** TODO [#C] Document localrepo limitations (treesitter grammars not included)

.localrepo only contains packages from package.el archives.
Treesitter grammars are downloaded separately by treesit-auto on first use.
For true offline reproducibility, need to cache treesitter grammars separately.

** TODO [#C] Integrate Buttercup (behavior-driven integration tests)

Complex workflow testing capability.

** TODO [#C] Build localrepo out (package snapshot system)

Repeatable installs and safe rollbacks.

** TODO [#C] Integrate difftastic (structural diffs)

Structural diffs that show semantic changes. Hook into cj/diff-buffer-with-file.

* Method 4: Contribute to the Emacs Ecosystem

** TODO [#C] Set up package-lint for elisp linting (chime, org-msg, wttrin)

Catch packaging issues automatically.

** TODO [#C] Set up melpazoid CI for MELPA submissions

Validates packages meet MELPA standards.

** TODO [#C] Set up elisp-check GitHub Action

Zero-config CI for Emacs packages.

** TODO [#C] Integrate undercover.el for test coverage

Measure and track test coverage over time.

* Method 5: Be Kind To Your Future Self

** TODO [#C] Add transcription workflow
:PROPERTIES:
:COMPLETE_CONFIG: [[file:docs/someday-maybe.org::2][todo.org:2-99]]
:END:

Complete code already exists in someday-maybe.org. Need today and recurring.

** TODO [#C] Implement org-reveal presentation workflow

Create reveal.js slides from org-mode.

* Method 6: Develop Disciplined Engineering Practices
** TODO [#A] First weekly triage by Sunday (establish habit)
SCHEDULED: <2025-11-03 Sun>

Review this inbox, cancel stale items, keep < 20 active. Track in calendar.

** TODO [#B] Track current metrics baseline

- [ ] Measure current startup time (time emacs --eval '(save-buffers-kill-emacs)')
- [ ] Count current active todos
- [ ] Set up tracking document for weekly metrics

** TODO [#C] Set up monthly research:shipped ratio tracking

Can't research next thing until current thing is implemented.

* Emacs Config Inbox
** DONE [#A] Irritant: Print should be keybound to capital P
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

Swapped keybindings:
- C-; b p → copy file path (safe, common action)
- C-; b P → print to PS (dramatic, requires shift)

** DONE [#A] Irritant: send buffer to printer must have confirmation
CLOSED: [2025-11-03 Sun]

Added y-or-n-p confirmation to cj/print-buffer-ps.
C-u prefix skips confirmation and prints in color.
