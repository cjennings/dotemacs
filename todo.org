*** 2025-09-02 Tue @ 14:06:03 -0500 Functionality Description
Tentative Package Name: Jumper
I typically use registers to jump between places, but I often forget the keybindings. Also, I sometimes overwrite registers by hitting the wrong key. Many Emacs users  don't even know about registers. I've seen posts from software developers asking how to conveniently store and jump to specific locations in a large code base.

To solve this I'd like to write a little elisp package that leverages Emacs vanilla register functionality to make jumping between locations using registers simple and transparent. The user won't have to think about registers or what character they've stored their location in at all. All keybindings will be based on keys from home row of the keyboard.

Preliminaries:
We will map the functionality to the keybinding prefix C-; j, but the prefix should be easy to configure.

Let's imagine a set of characters in a sequence. They could be any characters, but for the sake of simplicity we'll use the numbers from 0 to 9, and a one more character used for the "last location" -- the character "z".

What follows is a description of the workflow:
**** Adding Locations
keybinding: <prefix> space (store destination)
If the user is visiting a buffer and presses <prefix> space,
- the current location is stored in the next free register. if this is the first time they are storing a location, the first free register is 0.
user feedback: a message is displayed in the echo area saying "location stored."
If the user stays on the same location and presses prefix <space> again, they should receive a message in the echo area saying the location is already stored, and no changes to the register is made.

If the user moves to a new location and presses prefix <space> again, the next free register is used to store the location, in this case it would be 1. They can then iterate and store additional locations up to the last character in the sequence up to the limit of 10 registers (0 through 9). If they try to store a register after all 10 registers are filled, they will receive a message ("sorry - all jump locations are filled!").
**** Jump-To A Location
keybinding: <prefix> j (jump to destination)
NOTE: Whenever the user presses <prefix> j, that location is automatically stored in the "last location" register z.
***** When only one location is stored, and the user presses <prefix> j:
If there is only one location stored, the user IS at the location, and they press <prefix> j, they see an echo area message "you're already at the stored location."
If there is only one location stored in the sequence, and the user is NOT at that location, their location is stored in register z, then the user is immediately to their destination location via (jump-to-register).
user feedback: a message is displayed in the echo area saying "jumped to location."
If the user presses <prefix> J again, they are automatically taken back to the location in register z. and the same user feedback message is displayed.
In other words, after the user stores one location and moves elsewhere, pressing <prefix> j will jump back and forth between the two places.
***** When multiple locations are stored, and the user presses <prefix> j:
A completing read is displayed with all the locations between 0 and 9 along with register z (their last location) at the bottom.
Each line contains the letter as well as the content that the register would normally display. In other words, it could just be the register list is displayed, but narrowed down to 0 - 9 and z.

When the user chooses a location 0 -9, z from completing read:
- The current location is stored in register z, replacing their last location
- They are taken to the location via (jump-to-register).
user feedback: a message is displayed in the echo area saying "jumped to location."
**** Removing Locations
keybinding: <prefix> d
A completing read is displayed with the first item (where the cursor is on) being "Cancel".
The rest of the registers are displayed in descending order, i.e., from 9 to 0.
Note: the z register is not displayed.
Selecting a register from the list:
- removes that item from the list, and removes the location stored in the register.
- if the item is NOT the top one in the register, it reorders the rest of the sequence
  in other words, if 0 - 9 are all stored, and:
  the user removes item 7:
  - location 8 is restored in 7
  - location 9 is stored in 8
  the user removes item 0
  - location 1 is stored in 0
  - location 2 is stored in 1
  - location 3 is stored in 2
  - location 4 is stored in 3
  - location 5 is stored in 4
  - location 6 is stored in 5
  - location 7 is stored in 6
  - location 8 is stored in 7
  - location 9 is stored in 8
user feedback: a message is displayed in the echo area saying "location removed."
**** Open Questions
- Are there buffers which the user should not be able to store in a register?
- How can we prevent the user from creating issues by adding to the registers 0 through 9 by M-x point-to-register or it's keybinding? Is there a way to block or reserve those registers? Or is it better to just choose a sequence that is the least likely to be used by a human user? If so, what would that sequence be?
- Is 10 registers enough for a normal developer?
- I should probably
- Can I use a vector/list internally and map to registers behind the scenes?
Depending on context, can I add the
- Function name at point
- File name + line number
- First few words of the line
Do we think the reordering behavior when deleting locations might confuse users? How to simplify?
What happens if a buffer is deleted that doesn't have a file associated with it? If we're using registers underneath, how do registers handle this?

** DOING [#B] Eshell Improvements
*** Understanding Your Current Setup

I can see you have a well-structured eshell and vterm configuration. Your eshell setup includes:

- Custom prompt configuration
- Aliases for common operations
- Integration with remote servers via TRAMP
- Visual command handling
- History management
- Integration with xterm-color for proper ANSI colors

*** Clarifying Questions

1. Are you experiencing any specific issues with your eshell setup?
2. Do you have any particular workflows you'd like to optimize with eshell?
3. Are there any terminal features you miss when using eshell?

*** Recommended Approach

Without knowing your specific pain points, I'll recommend several high-value improvements that would enhance your eshell experience:

1. Add command completion enhancements
2. Improve directory navigation
3. Add better history searching
4. Include directory tracking and shell command integration
5. Enhance visual output handling
6. Improve eshell buffer management
7. Add helpful utility functions

*** Recommended Code Changes

#+end_src

*** Explanation of Key Improvements

1. *pcmpl-args*: Provides better argument completion for command-line tools.

2. *company-shell*: Brings Emacs' powerful completion framework to eshell with support for commands, environment variables, and more.

3. *eshell-z*: Implements z/autojump functionality, allowing you to jump to frequently visited directories with minimal keystrokes.

4. *eshell-up*: Makes navigating up directories easier with the =up= command.

5. *History searching*: The custom function provides interactive history searching with completion.

6. *Directory tracking and buffer naming*: Renames eshell buffers to include the current directory, making multiple eshell sessions easier to manage.

7. *Layout improvements*: The smart window splitting function determines the best way to display eshell based on your current window configuration.

These enhancements should make your eshell experience more productive while maintaining the flexibility and integration with Emacs that makes eshell valuable.

** TODO [#B] Add All ERT Tests Into Separate Directory
Tests should be added to a separate directory rather than the end of each elisp file.
Gather them together, move them there, and make it easy to run tests per module and workflow.
** TODO [#B] Get Tufte.css working and as a separate entry
Below is one way to get Org-mode’s HTML exporter to play nicely with Tufte-CSS.  The basic recipe is:

1. Inject Tufte’s stylesheet into every HTML export
2. Teach Org to emit the little “margin-toggle” + “sidenote” markup that tufte.css expects for footnotes
3. (Optionally) wrap images in <figure> so you get tufte-style captions out of the box

Along the way you’ll see where Org’s default HTML‐classes line up with tufte.css and where you have to override them.

— 1 Inject tufte.css into your exports
Put tufte.css somewhere your exported HTML can see it (for example
~/.emacs.d/assets/tufte.css or a URL on your webserver).  Then in your init.el:

(with-eval-after-load 'ox-html
;; 1a) tell Org to link in your tufte.css
(setq org-html-head-extra
"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/assets/tufte.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>")
;; 1b) enable HTML5 “fancy” output (so you get <figure> around images)
(setq org-html-html5-fancy t
org-html-inline-images  t))

— 2 Turn Org footnotes into Tufte sidenotes
By default Org emits
<sup class=…><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1">[1]</a></sup>
…and then a big =<div id="footnotes">= at the bottom.

Tufte-CSS wants each footnote inline, wrapped in
<label class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">…your note…</span>

We can override two Org variables:

(with-eval-after-load 'ox-html
;; format of each inline footnote reference
(setq org-html-footnote-format
(concat
"<label for=\"%1$s\" class=\"margin-toggle\">"
"&#8853;</label>"
"<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"%1$s\" class=\"margin-toggle\"/>"
"<span class=\"sidenote\">%2$s</span>"))
;; drop Org’s default footnote list at the end
(setq org-html-footnote-separator ""))

Once you do that, exporting an Org file with footnotes will generate the markup tufte.css needs to float them in the margin.

— 3 (Optionally) get <figure> + <figcaption> around images
If you set =org-html-html5-fancy= to t (see step 1) Org will automatically emit:

<figure>
<img src="…"/>
<figcaption>Your caption</figcaption>
</figure>

and tufte.css already has rules for =<figure class="figure">= etc.

— 4 Common pitfalls
• Make sure your href in =org-html-head-extra= actually points to the css that the browser can load (absolute vs. relative).
• If you still see a “Footnotes” section at the bottom, double-check that =org-html-footnote-separator= is set to the empty string and that your init-file got re-evaluated.
• On Windows or if you’re testing locally, run e.g. =python3 -m http.server= inside your export folder so your browser can fetch the CSS.

— 5 Unit test for your footnote hack
Drop this in =~/.emacs.d/tests/test-org-tufte.el= and run =M-x ert RET t RET=:

(require 'ert)
;; load your config; adjust the path if necessary
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")

(ert-deftest org-tufte-footnote-format-test ()
"Ensure each footnote reference becomes a margin-toggle + sidenote."
(let/ ((id      "fn:42")
(content "My note.")
(html    (format org-html-footnote-format id content)))
(should (string-match-p "class=\"margin-toggle\"" html))
(should (string-match-p "<span class=\"sidenote\">My note\\.</span>" html))
;; it must not accidentally reintroduce Org’s bottom-of-page footnote div
(should-not (string-match-p "div id=\"footnotes\"" html))))

Once that test passes, you know your footnotes are being rewritten into Tufte-style side notes.  From there, you can sprinkle in additional filters (e.g. wrap =<blockquote>= in a =.sidenote= class, override list/p table styles, etc.) or just let the rest of tufte.css style Org’s default tags (h1, p, ul, table, code, etc.).

Enjoy your beautifully-typeset Org → HTML exports in true Tufte style!

*** 2025-06-28 Sat @ 12:42:19 -0500 User's Method for Alarms In Emacs
This is more than I actually want, but leaving here for reference.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I am quite happy with the system I use, which does (I think) exactly what you want. It has two parts: an Emacs part that uses appt.el to schedule the reminders and a small shell program (I'm using Linux) that creates the popup + sound notification. Here I share the code for both parts.

A) Code in ~/.emacs.d/init.el

(require 'appt)
(appt-activate t)

(setq appt-message-warning-time 5) ; Show notification 5 minutes before event
(setq appt-display-interval appt-message-warning-time) ; Disable multiple reminders
(setq appt-display-mode-line nil)

; Use appointment data from org-mode
(defun my-org-agenda-to-appt ()
(interactive)
(setq appt-time-msg-list nil)
(org-agenda-to-appt))

; Update alarms when...
; (1) ... Starting Emacs
(my-org-agenda-to-appt)

; (2) ... Everyday at 12:05am (useful in case you keep Emacs always on)
(run-at-time "12:05am" (* 24 3600) 'my-org-agenda-to-appt)

; (3) ... When TODO.txt is saved
(add-hook 'after-save-hook
'(lambda ()
(if (string= (buffer-file-name) (concat (getenv "HOME") "/ideas/TODO.txt"))
(my-org-agenda-to-appt))))

; Display appointments as a window manager notification
(setq appt-disp-window-function 'my-appt-display)
(setq appt-delete-window-function (lambda () t))

(setq my-appt-notification-app (concat (getenv "HOME") "/bin/appt-notification"))

(defun my-appt-display (min-to-app new-time msg)
(if (atom min-to-app)
(start-process "my-appt-notification-app" nil my-appt-notification-app min-to-app msg)
(dolist (i (number-sequence 0 (1- (length min-to-app))))
(start-process "my-appt-notification-app" nil my-appt-notification-app (nth i min-to-app) (nth i msg)))))

B) Code in ~/bin/appt-notification

#!/bin/sh

TIME="$1"
MSG="$2"

notify-send -t 0 "<br>Appointment in $TIME minutes:<br>$MSG<br>"
play "~/bin/alarm.wav"

To get voice notifications you could replace the last line (play) with the following:

espeak "Appointment in $TIME minutes: $MSG"

** TODO [#C] Evolve Dupre Theme
Here are some ideas for making dupre-theme a bit more “complete” and future-proof as an Emacs theme.  You don’t have to do all of them, of course, but most “modern” themes ship a fair number of these extra faces and integrations.
*** TODO [#A] Fill out the “standard” Emacs faces
• error / warning / success
• link / link-visited / shadow
• highlight / secondary-selection
• tooltip / tooltip-selection / tooltip-tip
• underline / strike-through
• match / search / lazy-highlight (you already have some isearch)
• info-title-1…info-title-5, info-header-node, help-*-face
*** TODO [#A] Cosmetic / code-style notes
• Factor out a helper macro to reduce repetition:
#+begin_src elisp
  (defmacro dupre-face (face &rest specs)
    `(,face ((t ,specs))))
#+end_src
• Use =custom-theme-set-faces= only once; wrap your =when (>= emacs-major-version…)= inside it rather than nesting top-level.
• Move your ERT tests into a separate file like =dupre-theme-test.el= so that the main theme file stays lean.

*** TODO [#A] Fix launch problem with dupre
**** cj [2025-08-16 23:45:50]
[[file:.emacs.d/themes/dupre-theme.el::;;; dupre-theme.el --- A dark and elegant theme for Emacs -*- lexical-binding: t -*-][dupre-theme.el]]

I have an issue launching "emacsclient -c -a ''" with this theme. With the built-in wombat theme, emacsclient launches fine. When I specify this theme to load during launch, emacsclient does not launch.

Here is what I see in the terminal when launching:

Is there something about how this theme is written that may be causing this? If it's unlikely, how would you recommend I diagnose this problem?



**** ChatGPT: o4-mini [2025-08-16 23:51:03]
It turns out that nothing mystical is happening in your =dupre-theme.el= that would prevent the Emacs server from creating its socket.  When =emacsclient= says:

emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?

it really does mean “there is no running Emacs –daemon laying down =<…>/server/= for me to talk to.”  By itself, loading a custom theme (even one with a few Unicode ellipses or =display-graphic-p= branches) will not stop the server socket from being created.  What is much more often the culprit is:

1.  Mis-using =emacsclient -a ''= so that it never actually starts the server, or
2.  Having a startup error in your init file (or theme) that aborts =server-start= before the socket ever gets written.

Here is how I’d go about diagnosing (and fixing) the situation:

1)  Make sure you can start Emacs –daemon cleanly, /without/ any of your custom code.

   From a shell, run

   emacs --daemon --debug-init --eval "(message \"daemon ok\")"

   – you should see a process stick around, and if you look at =~/.emacs.d/server/= you should find a valid socket file.

   If that does not happen, Emacs itself is aborting in your init.  Remove or comment out your calls to =load-theme=, your theme-specific code, all your =custom-set-…= blocks, and any other ELisp until you can get a clean daemon start.  Once that is rock-solid, re-introduce your theme.

2)  Once you can start the daemon by hand, verify that =emacsclient -c= can actually talk to it:

   emacsclient -c -n

   The =-n= is “don’t wait for the client buffer to finish,” so you’ll get your GUI frame immediately.  If that works, the server is up and your sockets are good.

3)  If you /really/ want =emacsclient -c -a ''= to both start Emacs –daemon /and/ immediately pop a graphical frame, you have two choices:

   •  Let =-a= fall back to =emacs --daemon=.  On many platforms simply omitting the =-a= will do this.
   •  Explicitly tell it:

   emacsclient -c -a "emacs --daemon"  # note the command in quotes

   On macOS/Homebrew, for instance, people often do

   alias ec='emacsclient -c -a "emacs --daemon"'

   so that if there is no server, emacsclient will shell out to =emacs --daemon=, launch it, and /then/ connect.

4)  If you still suspect your theme is triggering a startup error (and killing the daemon before it gets to =(server-start)=), you can sprinkle a tiny bit of ELisp into your init:

   #+begin_src elisp
     ;; very early in ~/.emacs or init.el
     (setq debug-on-error t)
     (add-hook 'after-init-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (message "finished init; about to (server-start)")))

     (require 'server)
     (unless (server-running-p)
       (server-start))
   #+end_src

   Then run:

   emacs --daemon --debug-init

   and watch =~/.emacs.d/server/server= get created or watch the =*Messages*= buffer or your =~/.emacs.d/emacs-debug.log= (if you redirect =--debug-init= output).  If there is a hard error in your theme, you will get a backtrace in your =*Backtrace*= buffer.

5)  Finally, a sanity check for your theme file.  Launch Emacs /without/ your init:

   emacs -Q

   Then:

   M-x load-file RET /path/to/dupre-theme.el RET
   M-x load-theme RET dupre RET

   If this produces any errors or warnings in =*Messages*= or =*Warnings*=, you have your smoking gun.

---

Summary
-------

•  *The theme itself isn’t going to silently block server-socket creation.*
•  *You almost certainly have either:*
–  A mis-invocation of =emacsclient -a ''= so that it never starts Emacs –daemon.
–  A genuine startup error in your init or in the theme that kills Emacs before =(server-start)= runs.
•  *Use*
emacs --daemon --debug-init
plus removing chunks of your init until you find the offending form.
•  *Test your theme in a vanilla Emacs (=-Q=)* to see any compile/load errors.

Once you have a clean =emacs --daemon= up and running you will find that

emacsclient -c   # or with your favorite fallback: -a "emacs --daemon"

just works, whether you are on wombat, solarized, or good old dupre.

*** TODO [#B] Make sure you define a “minimum package” set of faces so that folks don’t see glaring unstyled text in any part of Emacs, even if they never install extra packages.

*** TODO [#B] Improve terminal support:
• Detect true-color (=(display-graphic-p)=) vs 256-color vs 16-color and fall-back gracefully.
• Provide “256-color” approximations (you already do this), but you might want a simpler palette for legacy terminals.

*** TODO [#B] Other Packages
The rest is just more of the same—pick the most common modes/packages you and your users rely on and give them a quick coat of paint.  Once you’ve rounded out those faces you’ll have hit what most people expect from a “complete” modern Emacs theme.

Based on a quick skim of your modules/ directory (and the packages they pull in via use-package), here’s a non-exhaustive list of the major packages you’re using—along with the faces you should think about adding to dupre-theme so that nothing ends up looking “unstyled.”

1. completion/mini-frameworks
   • vertico (vertico-current, vertico-group-title, vertico-separator, vertico-doc)
   • orderless (orderless-match-face-0…3)
   • consult (consult-preview-line, consult-narrow, consult-region, consult-file)
   • marginalia (marginalia-annotation, marginalia-document, marginalia-cache)
   • embark (embark-general, embark-heading, embark-target, embark-helpful)
   • corfu + cape (corfu-default, corfu-current, corfu-bar, cape-file, cape-keyword etc.)
   • company (company-tooltip, company-tooltip-selection, company-scrollbar­-thumb)

2. ivy/counsel/swiper (if you ever load them side-by-side)
   • ivy-current-match, ivy-minibuffer-match-face-1…4
   • counsel-outline, swiper-match-face-1…

3. syntax checkers & LSP
   • flycheck (flycheck-error, flycheck-warning, flycheck-info)
   • eglot or lsp-mode (lsp-face-highlight-textual, lsp-face-highlight-read, lsp-face-semantic-type-…)
   • tree-sitter (tree-sitter-hl-face:function, :variable, :property, …)

4. git & diffs
   • magit (magit-section, magit-section-title, magit-hunk-heading, magit-branch, magit-log)
   • diff-hl / git-gutter (diff-hl-face-insert, diff-hl-face-delete, git-gutter:added, git-gutter:deleted)
   • diff-mode (diff-added, diff-removed, diff-context, diff-file-header)

5. project management & navigation
   • projectile (projectile-project-name, projectile-project-root)
   • treemacs (treemacs-root-face, treemacs-directory-face, treemacs-file-face)

6. Org-mode
   • org-document-title, org-level-1…org-level-8
   • org-checkbox, org-todo, org-done, org-warning, org-date, org-code, org-block
   • plus any “pretty” add-ons you use (org-bullets, org-modern, etc.)

7. Hydra / which-key / key-help
   • which-key (which-key-key-face, which-key-group-description-face, which-key-local-map-description-face)
   • hydra (hydra-face-red, hydra-face-blue, hydra-face-teal, hydra-face-amaranth)

8. visual helpers
   • rainbow-delimiters-depth-1…9
   • highlight-indent-guides-odd/even
   • highlight-parentheses-/
   • beacon (beacon), whitespace (whitespace-space, whitespace-tab, whitespace-newline)
   • display-line-numbers (line-number, line-number-current-line—you already have these)

9. UI polishers
   • all-the-icons (all-the-icons-blue, all-the-icons-red, …) on modeline or treemacs
   • doom-modeline (doom-modeline-bar, doom-modeline-buffer-path)
   • fancy-splash/dashboard-faces if you use a startup screen

10. terminals & shells
    • vterm (vterm-copy-region-highlight)
    • ansi-colors (ansi-color-face-bold, ansi-color-face-italic, ansi-color-[0…7])

To figure out exactly which ones you have in your modules, you can do for example:

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; from your ~/.emacs.d
  (let (pkgs)
    (dolist (f (directory-files "~/.emacs.d/modules" t "\\.el$"))
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert-file-contents f)
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (while (re-search-forward "use-package +\\([^ ]+\\)" nil t)
          (push (intern (match-string 1)) pkgs))))
    (delete-dups pkgs))
#+end_src

Then for each of those packages, grep in their repo for =defface= or check their manual to see which faces they define, and add reasonable dupre-colours for them. Once you’ve covered that list, you’ll have a “complete” theme that won’t leave any of your modules half-unstyled.

*** TODO [#C] Support the built-in “tab-bar” and “tab-group” faces (Emacs 27+)
• tab-bar              / tab-bar-tab / tab-bar-tab-inactive
• tab-bar-close        / tab-bar-separator
• tab-group-title      / tab-group-separator
*** TODO [#C] Add faces for =dired=, =diff=, =flycheck=/=flymake=, =magit= (or git-gutter),
=ediff=, =erc= etc.  For example:
• diff-added, diff-removed, diff-context, diff-file-header
• flycheck-error, flycheck-warning, flycheck-info
• magit-section, magit-log, magit-hunk-heading, magit-branch, etc.
*** TODO [#C] Org-mode
• org-level-1…org-level-8, org-document-title

*** TODO [#C] LSP / tree-sitter / syntax-aware faces
• lsp-face-highlight-textual, lsp-face-highlight-read, etc.

• which-key-key-face, which-key-local-map-description-face
• hydra-face-red / teal / blue
• rainbow-delimiters-depth-1…9

*** TODO [#C] Theme Metadata & Packaging
• Add =;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1"))= if you need a minimum.
• Consider adding a README with screenshots.
• A simple Makefile or script to refresh “theme metadata” (=M-x theme-inspect=, MELPA recipe).

*** TODO [#C] Tests
• Extend your ERT suite to cover more faces (org, diff, flycheck…).
• You might write a small helper that loops over a list of faces and asserts they’re defined without errors.

*** Example Sample Faces
Below is a small excerpt showing how you might start adding some of the “missing” standard faces and a couple org faces:

#+begin_src elisp
  (custom-theme-set-faces
   'dupre

   ;; … your existing faces …

   ;; standard global faces
   `(error   ((t (:foreground ,dupre-intense-red :weight bold))))
   `(warning ((t (:foreground ,dupre-yellow+1 :weight bold))))
   `(success ((t (:foreground ,dupre-green+1 :weight bold))))
   `(link    ((t (:foreground ,dupre-blue+1 :underline t))))
   `(shadow  ((t (:foreground ,dupre-gray))))
   `(highlight ((t (:background ,dupre-bg+1))))
   `(tooltip ((t (:foreground ,dupre-fg :background ,dupre-bg+2))))
   `(tooltip-selection ((t (:background ,dupre-bg+0))))

   ;; Org-mode sample
   `(org-document-title       ((t (:foreground ,dupre-yellow+2 :weight bold :height 1.2))))
   `(org-level-1              ((t (:foreground ,dupre-blue+2 :weight bold))))
   `(org-level-2              ((t (:foreground ,dupre-green+1))))
   `(org-checkbox             ((t (:foreground ,dupre-yellow :weight bold))))
   `(org-todo                 ((t (:foreground ,dupre-red :weight bold))))
   `(org-done                 ((t (:foreground ,dupre-green+2 :weight bold))))
   )

** TODO [#C] Emacs Config: Narrowing Org doesn't allow refresh by type
After generating an org agenda list, I can narrow the type to all DONE or IN-PROGRESS. However when I use my custom functions to just get the agenda for the current buffer, I can't. The scope has now widened and the refresh is for all buffers.
** TODO [#C] Add a Restrict to Subtree Org Agenda Command
In Org-mode the “agenda” machinery by default doesn’t pay any attention to your buffer­narrow — it always scans whole files in your =org-agenda-files=.  However, you can teach Org-agenda to only look between two points (the start and end of your current subtree) by using the built-in “restrict” hooks:

1.  =org‐agenda‐restrict=         – turn on restriction
2.  =org‐agenda‐restrict‐begin=  – a marker or position where scanning begins
3.  =org‐agenda‐restrict‐end=    – where it ends
4.  (optionally) set =org-agenda-files= to just your current file

Here is a drop-in =org-agenda-custom-commands= entry that will give you a “Subtree TODOs” view limited to the subtree you’re on.  Put this in your Emacs init:

#+begin_src  emacs-lisp
  ;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
  ;; 1) Define a custom agenda command "C" (hit C-c a C)
  ;;    that shows only TODO entries in the current subtree.
  ;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
  (with-eval-after-load 'org
    (add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
                 '("C"                                ; the key you press after C-c a
                   "Subtree TODOs"                   ; a descriptive name
                   ((todo ""                         ; match any TODO keyword
                          ;; === per-block settings ===
                          ;; only look in this file
                          (org-agenda-files (list buffer-file-name))
                          ;; enable the restriction engine
                          (org-agenda-restrict t)
                          ;; start at the top of the current heading
                          (org-agenda-restrict-begin
                           (progn (org-back-to-heading t) (point)))
                          ;; end at the end of this subtree
                          (org-agenda-restrict-end
                           (progn (org-end-of-subtree t) (point))))
                    ;; you can add more blocks here if you like
                    ))))
#+end_src

How this works, step by step:

• We bind a new custom command under the key “C” (so you’ll type =C-c a C=).
• In that command we use the =todo= matcher =""= to catch every headline whose state is one of your TODO keywords.
• We dynamically set
– =org-agenda-files= to just the current buffer’s file,
– =org-agenda-restrict= to non-nil so Org will honor the begin/end markers,
– =org-agenda-restrict-begin= to the position of the current heading,
– =org-agenda-restrict-end= to the end of the subtree.

When you invoke it (=C-c a C=), Org will only scan headlines in that slice of the file and will build you a mini-agenda of TODO items from exactly that subtree.

Quick alternative: if you don’t need the full agenda machinery (dates, deadlines, etc.) but just want a fast outline of your TODOs under the current heading, you can also use the sparse-tree command:

• =C-c / t=  ⇒ shows only the TODO headings in the narrowed or whole buffer as an indented outline.

— Tips & Pitfalls —

• Make sure your file is saved and in =org-agenda-files= (the snippet above forces it).
• Remember to call =org-narrow-to-subtree= (or let the command compute its own begin/end via =org-back-to-heading=/=org-end-of-subtree=).
• If you rename or move your file, Emacs must still see =buffer-file-name= valid.
• You can duplicate the above snippet for other TODO states, agenda views, or matchers (deadlines, tags, etc.)

With this in place you effectively get an agenda tailored to exactly the bit of tree you’re working on.
