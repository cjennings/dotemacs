;;; Commentary:
;; Tests for the cj/join-line-or-region function from custom-line-paragraph.el
;;
;; IMPORTANT NOTE ON REGION ACTIVATION IN BATCH MODE:
;; When testing functions that use (use-region-p) in batch mode, you must
;; explicitly activate the region. Unlike interactive Emacs, batch mode does
;; not automatically activate regions when you set mark and point.
;;
;; To properly test region-based behavior in batch mode:
;; 1. Enable transient-mark-mode: (transient-mark-mode 1)
;; 2. Set mark and point as needed
;; 3. Explicitly activate the mark: (activate-mark)
;;
;; Without these steps, (use-region-p) will return nil even when mark and
;; point are set, causing the function to take the no-region code path.
;; This is a common pitfall that junior developers may miss when writing
;; ERT tests for region-aware commands.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'testutil-general)

;; Add modules directory to load path
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "modules" user-emacs-directory))

;; Stub dependencies before loading the module
(defvar cj/custom-keymap (make-sparse-keymap)
  "Stub keymap for testing.")

;; Stub expand-region package
(provide 'expand-region)

;; Now load the actual production module
(require 'custom-line-paragraph)
