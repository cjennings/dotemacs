- At the start of EVERY session
- Before making any significant decisions
- When unclear about project direction or user preferences

**What's in this file:**
- User information (calendar, task list, working style)
- Session protocols (how we start, wrap up, and work together)
- File preferences and naming conventions
- Emacs-specific development best practices
- Project status, goals, and history

Claude can modify this document to make collaboration more efficient and effective.

* User Information

** Calendar Location
Craig's calendar is available at: =/home/cjennings/sync/org/gcal.org=

Use this to:
- Check meeting times and schedules
- Verify when events occurred
- See what's upcoming

** Task List Location
Craig's main task list is available at: =/home/cjennings/sync/org/roam/inbox.org=

Use this to:
- Add tasks to Craig's task list
- Add reminders for Craig before next session
- See all tasks he's working on outside this project

** Working Style

*** General Preferences
- Prefers detailed preparation before high-stakes meetings
- Values practice/role-play for negotiations and learning
- Makes decisions based on principles and timeline arguments
- Prefers written documentation over verbal agreements

*** Emacs as Primary Working Tool
- Craig uses Emacs for EVERYTHING (most-used software by significant margin)
- Consider Emacs packages alongside other software when recommending solutions
- Look for ways to streamline routine work with Emacs custom code if no packages exist
- Config breakage blocks ALL work (email, calendar, tasks, programming, reading, music)

** Miscellaneous Information
- Craig currently lives in New Orleans, LA
- Craig's phone number: 510-316-9357
- Maintains remote server at cjennings.net domain
- This project is in a git repository with remote at cjennings.net
- Also pushes to GitHub as backup remote

* Session Protocols

** Session Start Routine

When starting a new session with Craig:

1. **Read this file completely** to understand project context
2. **Check Active Reminders section** - Remind Craig of outstanding tasks
3. **Check Pending Decisions section** - Follow up on decisions needed
4. **Check V2MOM Progress** - Offer to work on top method/priority task
   - If no V2MOM exists, offer to create one using docs/workflows/create-v2mom.org
5. **Scan docs/workflows/ directory** for available workflows (see "Available Workflows" section below)

** IMPORTANT: Reminders Protocol

When starting a new session:
- Check "Active Reminders" section below
- Remind Craig of outstanding tasks he's asked to be reminded about
- This ensures important follow-up actions aren't forgotten

When Craig says "remind me" about something:
1. Add it to Active Reminders section in this file
2. If it's something he needs to DO, also add to =/home/cjennings/sync/org/roam/inbox.org= as TODO scheduled for today

** Workflows: "Let's run/do the [workflow name] workflow"

When Craig says this phrase:

1. **Check for exact match** in docs/workflows/ directory
   - If exact match found: Read that workflow file and guide through process
   - Example: "refactor workflow" → read docs/workflows/refactor.org

2. **If no exact match but similar word exists:** Ask for clarification
   - Example: User says "empty inbox" but we have "inbox-zero.org"
   - Ask: "Did you mean the 'inbox zero' workflow, or create new 'empty inbox'?"

3. **If no match at all:** Offer to create it
   - Say: "I don't see '[workflow-name]' yet. Create it using create-workflow process?"
   - If yes: Do create-workflow workflow, then use immediately (validates new workflow)

** "I want to create an X workflow" - Creating New Workflows

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This is different from running an existing workflow!

When Craig says "I want to create an X workflow":
- This means: **CREATE a workflow definition** for doing X (meta-work)
- This does **NOT** mean: "let's DO X right now" (the actual work)
- Triggers the create-workflow process from docs/workflows/create-workflow.org

*Examples:*
- "I want to create an inbox zero workflow" → Create docs/workflows/inbox-zero.org
- "I want to create a refactor workflow" → Create docs/workflows/refactor.org
- "I want to create a code review workflow" → Create docs/workflows/code-review.org

** "What Kind of Day Has It Been?" - Summary and Journal Routine

When Craig asks this:

1. **Display summary** of work done and discussions
   - Include: events, accomplishments, decisions, observations
   - Write in Craig's voice (as if you were Craig)
   - He'll review and approve or adjust

2. **Add to Session History** below
   - Use timestamp format: =YYYY-MM-DD Day @ HH:MM TZ= (get TZ with =date +%z=)
   - Include summary from step 1
   - This creates permanent record for retrospectives

3. **Note:** This info can also be part of wrap-up summary

** "Wrap it up" / "That's a wrap" / "Let's call it a wrap" - End Session

When Craig says any of these phrases (or variations), execute wrap-up workflow:

1. **Write session notes** to this file (Session History section)
   - Key decisions made
   - Work completed
   - Context needed for next session
   - Any pending issues or blockers
   - New conventions or preferences learned
   - Critical reminders for tomorrow go in Active Reminders section

2. **Git commit and push all changes**
   - Check git status and diff
   - Create descriptive commit message
   - Include co-author attribution: =Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>=
   - Push to ALL remotes (origin at cjennings.net + github)
   - Ensure working tree is clean
   - Confirm push succeeded

3. **Valediction** - Brief, warm goodbye
   - Acknowledge the day's work
   - What was accomplished
   - What's ready for next session
   - Any important reminders
   - Keep it warm but concise

*Slash command:* =/wrap-it-up= triggers this same workflow

** 🔔 Desktop Notifications Workflow

**IMPORTANT: How Claude notifies Craig**

Long-running tasks (> 1 minute) or blocking questions trigger desktop notifications via =notify-send=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
notify-send "Claude Code" "Question: [Your input needed]" --urgency=normal
#+END_SRC

**When notifications ARE sent:**
- ✅ When explicitly needing decision/input (blocking questions)
- ✅ When multiple valid approaches exist and choice affects implementation
- ✅ When encountering errors that require user guidance
- ✅ **ONLY** when Claude cannot proceed without user input

**When notifications are NOT sent:**
- ❌ After completing tasks (informational updates)
- ❌ During normal progress updates
- ❌ When milestones are reached
- ❌ For status messages or completion notices
- ❌ ANY informational alerts

**Setup:**
- Requires =dunst= or similar notification daemon
- Works with =notify-send= command
- Always uses =--urgency=normal= (not critical)

**Purpose:**
Allows Craig to context-switch to other work while Claude runs long tasks. Get notified ONLY when input is needed. Check back when convenient for status updates.

** The docs/ Directory

Claude needs to add information to this NOTES file. For large amounts of information:

- Create separate document in docs/ directory
- Link it here with explanation of document's purpose
- The docs/ directory should **never be committed** to git repository
- Unless specified otherwise, all Claude-generated documents go in docs/ folder

**When to break out documents:**
- If this file gets very large (> 1500 lines)
- If information isn't all relevant anymore
- Example: Keep only last 3-4 months of session history here, move rest to separate file

* File Format Preferences

** ALWAYS Use Org-Mode Format

Craig uses Emacs as primary tool. **ALWAYS** create new documentation files in =.org= format, not =.md= (markdown).

*Rationale:*
- Org-mode files are well-supported in Emacs
- Can be easily exported to any other format (HTML, PDF, Markdown, etc.)
- Better integration with user's workflow

*Exception:* Only use .md if specifically requested or if file is intended for GitHub/web display where markdown is expected.

** NEVER Use Spaces in Filenames

**ALWAYS** use hyphens (=-=) to separate words in filenames. Underscores (=_=) are also acceptable.

*Rationale:*
- Spaces cause problems with links across different operating systems
- User works with Mac, Windows, Linux, and potentially other systems
- Hyphens create more reliable, portable filenames
- Easier to work with in command-line tools

*Examples:*
- ✓ Good: =project-meeting-notes.org=
- ✓ Good: =change-log-2025-11-04.md=
- ✗ Bad: =project meeting notes.org=
- ✗ Bad: =change log 2025.11.04.md=

* File Naming Conventions

** Files Too Large to Read

PDFs or other files that are too large for Claude to read should be prefixed with =TOOLARGE-= to prevent read errors that halt the session.

Example:
- Original: =assets/large-architectural-plans.pdf=
- Renamed: =assets/TOOLARGE-large-architectural-plans.pdf=

** Unreadable Binary Files (.docx Format)

Binary .docx files cannot be read directly by Claude. When encountering these:
- Convert to markdown format using pandoc: =pandoc file.docx -o file.md=
- Keep the original .docx file for reference
- Work with the converted .md file for analysis and editing

** CRITICAL: Always Keep Links Current

Many documents are linked in various org files using org-mode =file:= links. Craig relies on these links being valid at all times.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW - When renaming or moving ANY file:**

1. **BEFORE renaming:** Search ALL org files for references to that file
   - Use grep or search tools to find both filename and partial matches
   - Check in TODO items and event log sections

2. **Rename or move the file**

3. **IMMEDIATELY AFTER:** Update ALL =file:= links to new path/filename
   - Update links in task files
   - Update links in event logs
   - Update links in reference sections

4. **Verify:** Test a few updated links to ensure they point to valid files

Example workflow:
#+begin_example
# Step 1: Search before renaming
grep -rn "2025-10-15-invoice.pdf" *.org

# Step 2: Rename the file
mv documents/2025-10-15-invoice.pdf documents/2025-10-15-vendor-invoice.pdf

# Step 3: Update all references
# Edit affected .org files to change paths

# Step 4: Verify links work
#+end_example

*Why This is Critical:*
- Org files are primary task tracking and reference system
- Event logs document complete history with file references
- Craig depends on clicking links to access documents quickly
- Broken links disrupt workflow and make documentation unreliable

**NEVER rename or move files without updating links in the same session.**

* 🤔 PENDING DECISIONS

** Flymake/Flycheck Modeline Integration

Craig was interested in adding error/warning counts to the modeline but hasn't decided on implementation details yet.

**Questions to decide:**

1. **Flymake vs Flycheck?**
   - Flymake is built-in and works with LSP (eglot)
   - Flycheck requires installation but has more checker backends

2. **Format preference?**
   - Just counts: =E:3 W:5=
   - With symbols: =⚠ 3 ✖ 5=
   - Clickable to show diagnostics buffer?

3. **Placement?**
   - Left side near major-mode, or right side with VC branch?

4. **Active window only?**
   - Like your VC branch - only show in selected window

**Implementation is ready** - just need Craig's preferences and Claude can add it exactly how he wants it.

* 🧩 EMACS LISP DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES

**Critical Lessons: Preventing Parenthesis Errors**

Both humans and AI struggle with balanced parentheses in deeply nested Emacs Lisp code. Here are proven strategies to prevent this:

** For AI Code Generation

*** 1. Write Small, Focused Functions
- Keep functions under 15 lines when possible
- Each function should do ONE thing
- Easier to verify parentheses at a glance
- Easier to test in isolation

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Bad (deeply nested, hard to verify):
(defun process-data (data)
  (when (valid-p data)
    (let ((result (transform data)))
      (when result
        (let ((final (format result)))
          (when final
            (save final)))))))

Good (broken into helpers):
(defun process-data (data)
  (when (valid-p data)
    (save-result (format-result (transform-data data)))))

(defun transform-data (data) ...)
(defun format-result (result) ...)
(defun save-result (final) ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** 2. Test Immediately After Each Write
- Write function → check-parens → test load → repeat
- Don't batch multiple functions before testing
- Catch errors early when context is fresh

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# After writing each function:
emacs --batch file.el --eval '(check-parens)' && echo "✓"
#+END_SRC

*** 3. Prefer Write Over Multiple Edits
- For complex new code: use Write tool (complete file)
- Only use Edit for small, simple changes
- Incremental edits can introduce subtle paren mismatches
- Complete file Write is easier to verify

*** 4. Validate Before Committing
- Use pre-commit hooks to validate all .el files
- Prevents committing broken code
- Example in chime.el repository: .git/hooks/pre-commit

*** 5. Test Emacs Launch After Non-Trivial Changes
**CRITICAL: Always test that Emacs launches without errors after making changes**

After completing any non-trivial code changes (new modules, integrations, etc.):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# 1. Run unit tests (if applicable)
make test

# 2. Test that Emacs launches without backtrace
emacs --eval "(kill-emacs)"
#+END_SRC

This catches:
- Syntax errors in :command specifications
- Missing dependencies at load time
- Invalid use-package configurations
- Broken requires/provides

**When to do this:**
- ✅ After adding new checker definitions (flycheck, flymake)
- ✅ After creating new modules
- ✅ After modifying init.el or early-init.el
- ✅ Before committing changes
- ✅ After running all unit tests

**Example lesson:** The LanguageTool integration used =(eval (expand-file-name ...))= in
a =:command= specification, which caused a backtrace on startup. Testing Emacs launch
would have caught this immediately instead of discovering it on next restart.

** For Human Developers

*** 1. Use Structural Editing Modes
These PREVENT unbalanced parens:
- **paredit** - Classic, strict structural editing
- **smartparens** - More flexible, works with multiple languages
- **lispy** - Modal editing for lisps
- **electric-pair-mode** - Built-in, auto-closes parens

*** 2. Enable Real-time Validation
- **flycheck** + **flycheck-package** - Shows errors as you type
- **flymake** - Built-in alternative
- **rainbow-delimiters-mode** - Colors matching parens

*** 3. Quick Validation Commands
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x check-parens          ; Check current buffer
M-x byte-compile-file     ; More comprehensive checking
#+END_SRC

** Lessons from chime-org-contacts.el Development

*** Original Problem
Complex nested function with 6 levels of nesting:
- Hard to count parentheses manually
- AI kept adding/removing wrong number of closing parens
- Functions weren't defined after file load
- Wasted significant debugging time

*** Solution That Worked
Refactored into 3 helper functions:
1. =chime-org-contacts--parse-birthday= (10 lines)
2. =chime-org-contacts--format-timestamp= (4 lines)
3. =chime-org-contacts--insert-timestamp-after-drawer= (12 lines)

Main function became simple composition (10 lines).

**Result:**
- All functions defined correctly
- Easy to verify parens by eye
- Each function testable independently
- 24 tests written covering all cases

*** Key Insight
Breaking complex code into small helpers:
- ✅ Easier to verify correctness
- ✅ Easier to test
- ✅ Easier to maintain
- ✅ Self-documenting through function names
- ✅ AI and humans both succeed

Deeply nested code:
- ❌ Hard to verify
- ❌ Hard to test
- ❌ AI frequently makes paren errors
- ❌ Humans make mistakes too

** Tools and Workflow Summary

| Stage | Tool | Purpose |
|-------+------+---------|
| Writing | paredit/smartparens | Prevent errors |
| Editing | rainbow-delimiters | Visual verification |
| Testing | check-parens | Quick syntax check |
| Testing | emacs --eval "(kill-emacs)" | Verify Emacs launches |
| CI/CD | pre-commit hooks | Prevent bad commits |
| Review | byte-compile-file | Comprehensive check |

** Makefile - Comprehensive Testing & Validation Tool

A comprehensive Makefile is available in the repository root with targets for testing, validation, and utilities.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make                    # Show all available targets
make test               # Run all tests (unit + integration)
make test-file FILE=... # Run specific test file
make test-name TEST=... # Run tests matching pattern
make validate-parens    # Check for unbalanced parentheses
make validate-modules   # Load all modules to verify compilation
make compile            # Byte-compile all modules
make lint               # Run checkdoc, package-lint, elisp-lint
make profile            # Profile Emacs startup
make clean              # Remove test artifacts and compiled files
make reset              # Reset to first launch (destructive!)
#+END_SRC

* CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

** 🎯 What We're Doing
Working through a systematic approach to clean up and prioritize Craig's Emacs config work:

1. ✅ *COMPLETE V2MOM* (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Metrics) - DONE
2. ✅ *TRIAGE todo.org* - Used V2MOM to ruthlessly cancel ~60% of tasks
3. ⏳ *EXECUTE METHODS* - Working through prioritized tasks systematically
4. ⏳ *BUILD OBSERVABILITY* - Create profiling infrastructure (Method 3)
5. ⏳ *SYSTEMATIC EXECUTION* - Work through prioritized tasks one by one

** 📍 Where We Are Right Now
*Session Started:* 2025-10-30
*Current Step:* ✅ V2MOM COMPLETE - Executing methods systematically
*Time Committed:* Multiple sessions since 2025-10-30
*Status:* V2MOM complete, executing Method 1 & 2 tasks, good progress on metrics

** 📄 Key Documents

*** Primary Working Documents
- *V2MOM:* [[file:EMACS-CONFIG-V2MOM.org][EMACS-CONFIG-V2MOM.org]] - Strategic framework for Emacs config (✅ COMPLETE)
  - Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Metrics
  - Used for decision-making and weekly triage
  - Read this first to understand strategic direction
- *Issues Analysis:* [[file:../issues.org][../issues.org]] - Claude's detailed analysis with TIER system and implementations

** 🔑 Key Insights About Craig's Work Patterns

*** Strengths
- Thoughtful and strategic thinker
- Good research skills (thorough specs, complete code examples)
- Does ship things (dashboard, dirvish, network check fixes, transcription)
- Recognizes need for V2MOM framework
- Uses config daily for real work

*** Patterns to Address
1. *Research > Execution* - Had complete code for several features, still TODO
2. *Priority Inflation* - Too many [#A]/[#B] items, unclear what's actually urgent
3. *Hard to Say No* - [#C]/[#D] items should be CANCELLED but remain in list
4. *Side Projects Compete* - Dupre theme work competes with core config maintenance

*** What Craig Told Us About Himself
> "I am building tools both because they solve problems, but also because I enjoy building."

This is healthy! But need balance:
- Fix rough edges FIRST (daily pain points)
- Build fun stuff SECOND (after maintenance)
- Cancel distractions ALWAYS (Signal client, minimap, etc.)

** 🎯 Agreed Goals for This Project

*** Immediate (Next 2-3 Sessions)
1. ✅ Complete V2MOM
2. ✅ Triage todo.org using V2MOM as filter
3. ⏳ Execute quick wins: network check, bug fixes, integrations
4. ⏳ Build debug-profiling.el infrastructure

*** Short Term (Next Month)
5. Profile and optimize org-agenda performance
6. Ship reveal.js presentation workflow
7. Establish weekly triage ritual

*** Long Term (Ongoing)
8. Ship more than research
9. Maintain < 20 active todos
10. Measure metrics from V2MOM

** 🚫 Items That Should Be CANCELLED

From todo.org, these don't serve the vision:
- [#D] Signal Client - Not in vision
- [#D] Awesome-tray / mode-icons - Already have modeline
- [#C] Minimap - Interesting, not important
- [#C] Install Magit TODOs - Already works fine
- [#C] Git Timemachine litters buffers - Minor annoyance
- Many Dupre theme TODOs - Side project competing with maintenance

** 💡 Key Recommendations for Craig

*** Week 1: Strategy + Quick Wins
1. ✅ Complete V2MOM (2-3 hours)
2. ✅ Triage todo.org using V2MOM (1-2 hours)
3. ✅ Execute items you already have code for (2-3 hours)

*** Week 2: Observability Infrastructure
4. Build debug-profiling.el (3-4 hours)
5. Profile org-agenda (1 hour)

*** Week 3: Fix Performance + Ship Presentation
6. Fix org-agenda based on profiling (2-3 hours)
7. Ship reveal.js workflow (2 hours)

*** Ongoing: Maintenance Discipline
- Weekly triage ritual (30 min every Sunday)
- Measure metrics (startup time, agenda time, todo count)
- Ship > Research

** 🔄 Next Session Pickup Points

When starting next session, Claude should:

1. **Read this document first** to understand context
2. **Check Active Reminders** - Follow up on pending items
3. **Check Pending Decisions** - See if Craig has made decisions
4. **Check V2MOM status** - Continue with next priority method/task
5. **Ask Craig:** "What would you like to work on today?"

** 🎯 Success Metrics for This Project

We'll know this is working when:
- ✅ V2MOM is complete and provides clear strategic direction
- ✅ todo.org shrinks from ~50 to < 20 active items
- ✅ Craig ships 3-5 items per week (small but consistent)
- ⏳ Craig has profiling infrastructure to measure performance
- ⏳ Org agenda rebuild time is measured and improving
- ⏳ Weekly triage becomes habit

** 💬 Craig's Words to Remember

> "I think you should adjust issues.org with all your recommendations. They are exciting, eye-opening, and just feel right. Add even your guidance on latex. spot on. thanks for your honesty. I did ask for it and am genuinely grateful for your responses. I'll take action on them."

> "What I need help with is integrating this in with my existing todo.org file... Some of the tasks I've listed should probably just be deleted or better yet, marked CANCELLED."

> "I have about an hour to devote. You could lead me through it, I could do some questions/answer rounds with you to clarify my thinking."

> "There will always be cool ideas out there to implement and they will always be a web search away."

Craig is ready to execute. He asked for honesty and took it well. He recognizes the patterns and wants systematic help.

** 🛠️ Technical Context

*** Current Pain Points
1. Org agenda is slow (performance bottleneck) - Need profiling
2. ✅ Network check removed (was adding 1+ seconds to startup)
3. ✅ Missing functions fixed (cj/log-silently, cj/goto-git-gutter-diff-hunks)
4. Mail attachments workflow needs improvement
5. No profiling infrastructure to measure performance

*** Items Craig Already Has Code For
These can be executed immediately - just paste and test:
- ✅ Transcription workflow (implemented 2025-11-04)
- ✅ Difftastic integration (implemented 2025-11-03)
- Corfu migration (complete config, but deferred - Company works fine)

*** Architecture
- Modular structure: modules/*.el
- Good test coverage for utilities
- Modern packages: Vertico/Consult/Embark stack
- Local package development: chime.el, org-msg

   - Renamed docs/sessions/ → docs/workflows/
   - Renamed create-session.org → create-workflow.org
   - Updated all references throughout documentation
   - Clear terminology now:
     - "session" = working time period
     - "workflow" = documented process/routine
   - Examples: "Let's run the refactor workflow" vs "This session took 2 hours"

2. ✅ **Updated template docs/sessions/*.org → docs/workflows/*.org**
   - create-workflow.org - Meta-workflow for creating workflows

4. ✅ **Updated NOTES.org throughout**
   - Fixed all "session type" → "workflow" references
   - Updated "Available Session Types" → "Available Workflows"
   - Updated all workflow file paths
   - Session history references updated

*Key Decisions:*
- "Session" exclusively means working time period
- "Workflow" exclusively means documented routine/process

*** Session: Create V2MOM Workflow Document

*Time:* ~30 minutes
*Status:* ✅ COMPLETE - Generic V2MOM workflow documented

*What We Completed:*
1. ✅ **Created docs/workflows/create-v2mom.org**
   - Fully generic workflow applicable to any project/goal
   - Works for health, finance, software, personal infrastructure, etc.
   - Comprehensive 8-phase process with examples across domains
   - Time estimate: ~2-3 hours to create a V2MOM

2. ✅ **Genericized from Emacs-specific version**
   - Removed all Emacs-specific instructions from process
   - Added diverse examples: health V2MOM, finance V2MOM, software V2MOM
   - Kept detailed Emacs config V2MOM as one example case study
   - Universal patterns identified: Fix → Stabilize → Build → Enhance → Sustain

3. ✅ **Comprehensive documentation**
   - Clear phase-by-phase instructions
   - Decision frameworks for common situations
   - Principles to follow (honesty over aspiration, concrete over abstract)
   - Living document guidance
   - Multiple real-world examples

*Key Decisions:*
- V2MOM process should be project-agnostic at its core
- Examples should span multiple domains to show universality
- Emacs config V2MOM serves as detailed case study showing impact
- Time commitment (2-3 hours) justified by weeks of focused work it enables

*Files Created:*
- docs/workflows/create-v2mom.org (comprehensive generic V2MOM workflow)

*Next Steps:*
- V2MOM workflow is now available for any future project
- Can be used to create V2MOMs for: chime.el, org-msg, health goals, finances, etc.
- Ready to use whenever Craig needs strategic framework for new initiative

** 2025-11-05 Tue @ 09:00 -0600

*** Session 2 - Scratch Buffer Configuration

*Time:* ~5 minutes
*Status:* ✅ COMPLETE - Scratch buffer opens in org-mode with cursor at end

*Problem:*
- Scratch buffer opened in lisp-interaction-mode
- Cursor positioned at beginning of buffer
- Craig wanted org-mode with cursor ready to type at end

*Solution:*
1. **Set scratch buffer to org-mode** - =(setopt initial-major-mode 'org-mode)=
2. **Move cursor to end on startup** - Added =emacs-startup-hook= to position cursor
3. **Updated comment syntax** - Changed =;;= to =#= in greeting messages for org-mode

*Files Modified:*
- modules/system-utils.el:186-203
  - Added =initial-major-mode= configuration
  - Added startup hook for cursor positioning
  - Updated greeting message comment syntax for org-mode compatibility

*Technical Details:*
- Used =emacs-startup-hook= to run after init completes
- Buffer name check ensures we only affect *scratch* buffer
- Greeting message now uses org-mode comment syntax (#)

*** Session 1 - Fix Google Calendar Password Prompts

*Time:* ~15 minutes
*Status:* ✅ COMPLETE - Fixed irritating password prompts every 10 minutes

*Problem:*
- Google Calendar auto-sync timer prompting for oauth2-auto.plist passphrase every ~10 minutes
- Interrupting workflow with pinentry dialogs
- Despite having gpg-agent configured with 400-day cache timeout

*Root Cause:*
- Line 27 in modules/auth-config.el: =(setenv "GPG_AGENT_INFO" nil)=
- This was telling Emacs to IGNORE the gpg-agent entirely
- Result: gpg-agent's 400-day cache was being bypassed
- Plstore (used by oauth2-auto) was loading too late in org-gcal-config

*Solution:*
1. **Disabled GPG_AGENT_INFO override** - Commented out line preventing agent use
2. **Added auth-source-cache-expiry** - 24-hour cache for decrypted credentials
3. **Moved plstore configuration** - From org-gcal-config to auth-config (loads earlier)
4. **Set plstore caching globally** - =plstore-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t=

*Files Modified:*
- modules/auth-config.el:
  - Commented out =(setenv "GPG_AGENT_INFO" nil)= (was preventing cache)
  - Added =(setq auth-source-cache-expiry 86400)= (24-hour cache)
  - Added new plstore use-package block with caching enabled
- modules/org-gcal-config.el:
  - Removed plstore configuration (now in auth-config.el)
  - Updated comments to reference global config

*Technical Details:*
- oauth2-auto.plist uses symmetric encryption (passphrase-based)
- gpg-agent.conf already had =default-cache-ttl 34560000= (400 days)
- gpg-agent needed to be reloaded: =gpgconf --reload gpg-agent=
- Plstore now caches passphrase indefinitely via gpg-agent

*User Quote:*
> "It's making me crazy!"

Totally valid! Getting interrupted every 10 minutes is legitimately maddening. Fixed! ✅

** 2025-11-04 Mon @ 15:00 -0600

*** Session 4 - External Dependencies Audit

*Time:* ~30 minutes
*Status:* ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive dependency analysis documented

*** Session 3 - LanguageTool Grammar Checker Test Suite

*Time:* ~1 hour
*Status:* ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive test suite with 15 passing tests

*What We Completed:*

1. ✅ **Created Test Fixtures** (tests/fixtures/)
   - grammar-errors-basic.txt - Common grammar errors (subject-verb, could of, etc.)
   - grammar-errors-punctuation.txt - Punctuation and spacing issues
   - grammar-correct.txt - Clean baseline for comparison
   - Deterministic fixtures for reliable testing

2. ✅ **Unit Tests** (test-flycheck-languagetool-setup.el)
   - 6 tests verifying LanguageTool installation and setup
   - Checks binary availability, wrapper script existence
   - Validates wrapper script structure (shebang, imports)
   - Tests error handling for missing arguments
   - All tests pass ✓ (< 1 second)

3. ✅ **Integration Tests** (test-integration-grammar-checking.el)
   - 9 tests covering end-to-end grammar checking workflow
   - Tests wrapper script with real LanguageTool execution
   - Validates flycheck-compatible output format
   - Normal cases: error detection, output formatting
   - Boundary cases: empty files, single word, multiple paragraphs
   - Error cases: nonexistent files, missing arguments
   - All tests pass ✓ (~35 seconds with real LanguageTool execution)

4. ✅ **Applied Testing Philosophy** from quality-engineer.org
   - Focus on OUR code (wrapper script), not flycheck internals
   - Trust external frameworks work correctly
   - Test real integration with actual LanguageTool execution
   - Comprehensive docstrings listing integrated components
   - Clear test categories: Normal, Boundary, Error cases
   - No over-mocking of domain logic

*Key Decisions:*
- Don't test flycheck framework internals (trust it works)
- Test our integration code with real external tools
- Use real fixtures instead of generated test data
- Integration tests run slower but provide high confidence

*Files Created:*
- tests/test-flycheck-languagetool-setup.el
- tests/test-integration-grammar-checking.el
- tests/fixtures/grammar-errors-basic.txt
- tests/fixtures/grammar-errors-punctuation.txt
- tests/fixtures/grammar-correct.txt

*Test Results:*
- Unit tests: 6/6 passing
- Integration tests: 9/9 passing
- Total: 15/15 tests ✓

*** Session 2 - Emergency Bug Fixes & Modeline Polish

*Time:* ~30 minutes
*Status:* ✅ COMPLETE - Fixed async buffer error and improved modeline spacing

*What We Completed:*

1. ✅ **Fixed Critical Async Buffer Error on Startup**
   - Problem: "Selecting deleted buffer" error in async.el during init
   - Root cause: wttrin-mode-line-mode starting async HTTP request during init
   - Solution: Delayed activation using after-init-hook
   - Weather widget now loads AFTER Emacs finishes initializing
   - Prevents async buffer from being killed before request completes

2. ✅ **Fixed Parenthesis Error in weather-config.el**
   - Removed extra closing parenthesis that prevented file from loading
   - Verified with check-parens

3. ✅ **Improved Modeline Right-Side Spacing**
   - Problem: Right-most icon (weather) appeared flush with window edge
   - Discovered: Regular spaces were being trimmed by right-align mechanism
   - Solution: Added 2 non-breaking spaces (U+00A0) after misc-info segment
   - Provides visual breathing room without being excessive

*Key Technical Insights:*
- Async operations during init need careful timing (use after-init-hook)
- mode-line-right-align-edge 'right-margin trims trailing regular spaces
- Non-breaking spaces (U+00A0) survive trimming in modeline format

*Files Modified:*
- modules/weather-config.el - Added after-init-hook delay for mode-line widget
- modules/modeline-config.el - Added 2 non-breaking spaces at end

*** Session 1 - Complete Transcription Workflow Implementation

*Time:* ~3 hours

1. ✅ **Installed Whisper Locally**
   - Created install-whisper.sh with AUR support (python-openai-whisper)
   - Created uninstall-whisper.sh for clean removal
   - Installed via AUR successfully
   - Added --yes flag for non-interactive automation

2. ✅ **Created CLI Transcription Scripts**
   - scripts/local-whisper - Uses installed Whisper (works offline)
   - scripts/oai-transcribe - Uses OpenAI API (faster, requires API key)
   - Both scripts output to stdout, log to stderr
   - Proper error handling and validation

3. ✅ **Implemented Full Transcription Module** (modules/transcription-config.el)
   - Async transcription workflow (non-blocking)
   - Desktop notifications (started, complete, error)
   - Output: audio.txt (transcript) + audio.log (process logs)
   - Log cleanup: auto-delete on success (configurable)
   - Modeline integration: Shows ⏺count of active transcriptions
   - Clickable modeline to view *Transcriptions* buffer
   - Process tracking and management

4. ✅ **Comprehensive Test Suite - 60 Tests, All Passing**
   - test-transcription-audio-file.el (16 tests) - Extension detection
   - test-transcription-paths.el (11 tests) - File path logic
   - test-transcription-log-cleanup.el (5 tests) - Log retention
   - test-transcription-duration.el (9 tests) - Time formatting
   - test-transcription-counter.el (11 tests) - Active count & modeline
   - test-integration-transcription.el (8 tests) - End-to-end workflows
   - Tests found and fixed 1 bug (nil handling in audio detection)
   - Normal, boundary, and error cases covered

5. ✅ **Reorganized Keybindings**
   - Moved gcal from C-; g/t/r/G to C-; g s/t/r/c submenu
   - Created C-; t transcription submenu:
     - C-; t a → transcribe audio
     - C-; t v → view transcriptions
     - C-; t k → kill transcription
   - Dired/Dirvish: T → transcribe file at point
   - which-key integration for discoverability

6. ✅ **Added Audio Extensions to user-constants.el**
   - Centralized cj/audio-file-extensions list
   - Shared across transcription and future audio features
   - Used defvar (not defcustom) per Craig's preference

*Key Decisions:*
- **Simplified UX:** No org-capture integration (initially planned), just file in/out
- **Minimalist approach:** Audio files → .txt transcripts (no complex templates)
- **Testable architecture:** Pure functions separated from I/O
- **defvar over defcustom:** All configuration variables use defvar

*Files Created:*
- scripts/install-whisper.sh
- scripts/uninstall-whisper.sh
- scripts/local-whisper
- scripts/oai-transcribe
- modules/transcription-config.el
- tests/test-transcription-*.el (5 test files)

*Files Modified:*
- modules/user-constants.el (added cj/audio-file-extensions)
- modules/org-gcal-config.el (reorganized keybindings to C-; g submenu)

   - Quoted Lisp symbols with backticks (=vc-diff=, =describe-mode=)
   - Fixed single quotes in examples to use proper backtick quoting
   - File now passes checkdoc and byte-compilation cleanly

2. ✅ Created =/wrap-it-up= workflow automation
   - Slash command: =.claude/commands/wrap-it-up.md=
   - Phrase recognition: "let's wrap it up", "that's a wrap", "let's call it a wrap"
   - Workflow: Write notes → Git commit & push → Valediction summary
   - Documented in both slash command and NOTES.org terminology section
   - Ensures clean session endings with no lost work

3. ✅ Added reminder for Flymake/Flycheck modeline integration
   - Created "PENDING DECISIONS" section in NOTES.org
   - Questions documented: Flymake vs Flycheck, format, placement, active window
   - Implementation ready - just needs user preferences
   - Craig will be reminded proactively at next session start

*Key Decisions:*
- Dual documentation approach (slash command + phrase recognition) for reliability
- Craig expressed gratitude: "my life is genuinely improving while working with you"
- Modeline work quality bar: must pass all linters before shipping

** 2025-10-31 Thu @ 14:00 -0600
