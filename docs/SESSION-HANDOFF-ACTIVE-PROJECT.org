#+TITLE: 🚨 ACTIVE PROJECT - READ THIS FIRST 🚨
#+AUTHOR: Claude Code Session Notes
#+DATE: 2025-10-30

* CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

** 🎯 What We're Doing
Working through a systematic approach to clean up and prioritize Craig's Emacs config work:

1. ✅ *COMPLETE V2MOM* (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Metrics) - IN PROGRESS
2. ⏳ *TRIAGE todo.org* - Use V2MOM to ruthlessly cancel ~60% of tasks
3. ⏳ *EXECUTE TIER 1* - Ship quick wins (network check removal, Corfu, bug fixes)
4. ⏳ *BUILD OBSERVABILITY* - Create profiling infrastructure (TIER 2)
5. ⏳ *SYSTEMATIC EXECUTION* - Work through prioritized tasks one by one

** 📍 Where We Are Right Now
*Session Started:* 2025-10-30
*Current Step:* V2MOM Methods section (60% complete - Vision + Values done)
*Time Committed:* ~1 hour sessions, working systematically
*Status:* PAUSED between sessions - resuming later this evening

** 📄 Key Documents

*** Primary Working Documents
- *V2MOM:* [[file:emacs-config-v2mom.org][emacs-config-v2mom.org]] - Strategic framework (ACTIVELY EDITING)
- *Issues Analysis:* [[file:../issues.org][../issues.org]] - Claude's detailed analysis with TIER system and implementations
- *Current Todos:* [[file:../todo.org][../todo.org]] - Craig's existing task list (~50+ items, needs triage)

*** Reference Documents
- *Config Root:* [[file:../init.el][../init.el]]
- *Modules:* [[file:../modules/][../modules/]]
- *Tests:* [[file:../tests/][../tests/]]

** 🔑 Key Insights About Craig's Work Patterns

*** Strengths
- Thoughtful and strategic thinker
- Good research skills (thorough specs, complete code examples)
- Does ship things (dashboard, dirvish, network check fixes)
- Recognizes need for V2MOM framework
- Uses config daily for real work

*** Patterns to Address
1. *Research > Execution* - Has complete code for Corfu, difftastic, transcription workflow... still TODO
2. *Priority Inflation* - Too many [#A]/[#B] items, unclear what's actually urgent
3. *Incomplete Strategy* - V2MOM structure exists but sections are empty
4. *Hard to Say No* - [#C]/[#D] items should be CANCELLED but remain in list
5. *Side Projects Compete* - Dupre theme work competes with core config maintenance

*** What Craig Told Us About Himself
> "I am building tools both because they solve problems, but also because I enjoy building."

This is healthy! But need balance:
- Fix rough edges FIRST (daily pain points)
- Build fun stuff SECOND (after maintenance)
- Cancel distractions ALWAYS (Signal client, minimap, etc.)

** 🎯 Agreed Goals for This Project

*** Immediate (Next 2-3 Sessions)
1. ✅ Complete V2MOM (IN PROGRESS)
2. ⏳ Triage todo.org using V2MOM as filter
3. ⏳ Execute quick wins: network check, Corfu migration, bug fixes
4. ⏳ Build debug-profiling.el infrastructure

*** Short Term (Next Month)
5. Profile and optimize org-agenda performance
6. Ship reveal.js presentation workflow
7. Establish weekly triage ritual

*** Long Term (Ongoing)
8. Ship more than research
9. Maintain < 20 active todos
10. Measure metrics from V2MOM

** 📋 TIER System from issues.org

*** TIER 1: Do These First (High Impact, Low Effort) - 1 weekend
- Remove network check (15 min)
- Fix missing functions (30 min)
- Corfu migration (2 hours)
- Mood-line switch (30 min)
- Bug fixes (1 hour)

*** TIER 2: Build Observability (HIGHEST VALUE) - 1 week
- Create debug-profiling.el module (3-4 hours)
- Profile org-agenda-rebuild (1 hour)
- Add instrumentation and caching (2 hours)
- Test org-agenda filtering functions (2-3 hours)

*** TIER 3: Quick Wins (After Profiling) - 1-2 hours each
- Reveal.js presentation workflow (2 hours)
- Difftastic integration (30 min)
- Local package development workflow (1 hour)

*** TIER 4: Maybe/Someday (Probably Never)
- Code-maat reimplementation (HOLD)
- LaTeX config (HOLD until concrete need)
- Elfeed dashboard (HOLD - unclear if actually used)
- DWIM shell integration (HOLD - current solution works)
- Jumper package (HOLD - already maintaining chime + org-msg)

** 🚫 Items That Should Be CANCELLED

From todo.org, these don't serve the vision:
- [#D] Signal Client - Not in vision
- [#D] Awesome-tray / mode-icons - Already have modeline
- [#C] Minimap - Interesting, not important
- [#C] Install Magit TODOs - Already works fine
- [#C] Git Timemachine litters buffers - Minor annoyance
- Many Dupre theme TODOs - Side project competing with maintenance

## 💡 Key Recommendations for Craig

### Week 1: Strategy + Quick Wins
1. Complete V2MOM (2-3 hours)
2. Triage todo.org using V2MOM (1-2 hours)
3. Execute items you already have code for (2-3 hours)

### Week 2: Observability Infrastructure
4. Build debug-profiling.el (3-4 hours)
5. Profile org-agenda (1 hour)

### Week 3: Fix Performance + Ship Presentation
6. Fix org-agenda based on profiling (2-3 hours)
7. Ship reveal.js workflow (2 hours)

### Ongoing: Maintenance Discipline
- Weekly triage ritual (30 min every Sunday)
- Measure metrics (startup time, agenda time, todo count)
- Ship > Research

** 🔄 Next Session Pickup Points

When starting next session, Claude should:

1. **Read this document first** to understand context
2. **Check V2MOM status** - If incomplete, continue there
3. **Reference issues.org** for detailed technical recommendations
4. **Reference todo.org** for items to triage
5. **Ask Craig:** "Where did we leave off? V2MOM? Triage? Execution?"

** 📞 Questions to Ask Craig Next Session

*IMMEDIATE (when resuming):*
- "Ready to continue V2MOM? We left off at Methods section."
- "How much time do you have?"

*FOR METHODS SECTION:*
Show Craig the draft list and ask:
- "Which methods do you already do consistently?"
- "Which do you want to do but don't yet?"
- "Am I missing any important methods?"

*AFTER V2MOM COMPLETE:*
- "Ready to triage todo.org using the V2MOM?"
- "Should we execute quick wins or continue systematic triage?"

** 🎯 Success Metrics for This Project

We'll know this is working when:
- ✅ V2MOM is complete and provides clear strategic direction
- ✅ todo.org shrinks from ~50 to < 20 active items
- ✅ Craig ships 3-5 items per week (small but consistent)
- ✅ Craig has profiling infrastructure to measure performance
- ✅ Org agenda rebuild time is measured and improving
- ✅ Weekly triage becomes habit

** 💬 Craig's Words to Remember

> "I think you should adjust issues.org with all your recommendations. They are exciting, eye-opening, and just feel right. Add even your guidance on latex. spot on. thanks for your honesty. I did ask for it and am genuinely grateful for your responses. I'll take action on them."

> "What I need help with is integrating this in with my existing todo.org file... Some of the tasks I've listed should probably just be deleted or better yet, marked CANCELLED."

> "I have about an hour to devote. You could lead me through it, I could do some questions/answer rounds with you to clarify my thinking."

Craig is ready to execute. He asked for honesty and took it well. He recognizes the patterns and wants systematic help.

** 🛠️ Technical Context

*** Current Pain Points
1. Org agenda is slow (performance bottleneck)
2. Network check adds 1+ seconds to startup (technical debt)
3. Missing functions cause errors (cj/log-silently, cj/goto-git-gutter-diff-hunks)
4. Mail attachments workflow is awkward
5. No profiling infrastructure to measure performance

*** Items Craig Already Has Code For
These can be executed immediately - just paste and test:
- Transcription workflow (complete bash + elisp in todo.org:2-99)
- Difftastic integration (complete config in todo.org:1211-1223)
- Corfu migration (complete config in todo.org:1611-1639)

*** Architecture
- Modular structure: modules/*.el
- Good test coverage for utilities
- Modern packages: Vertico/Consult/Embark stack
- Local package development: chime.el, org-msg

** 🚀 Current Session Notes

*** 2025-10-30 Session 1 - V2MOM In Progress
*Time:* ~1 hour
*Status:* PAUSED - V2MOM 60% complete

*What We Completed:*
1. ✅ Created docs/ directory structure
2. ✅ Created SESSION-HANDOFF-ACTIVE-PROJECT.org (this file)
3. ✅ Created emacs-config-v2mom.org
4. ✅ Created values-comparison.org (analysis doc)
5. ✅ Completed Vision (already existed, kept as-is)
6. ✅ Completed Values section (Intuitive, Fast, Simple)
   - Intuitive: Muscle memory, mnemonics, which-key timing, "newspaper" code
   - Fast: Startup < 2s, org-agenda is THE bottleneck, everything else acceptable
   - Simple: Production software practices, simplicity produces reliability

*What's Next:*
1. ⏳ *Methods* - IN PROGRESS (have draft list, need Craig's input)
2. ⏳ *Obstacles* - TODO
3. ⏳ *Metrics* - TODO
4. ⏳ *Finalize V2MOM* - Review and commit

*Draft Methods List (Need Craig's Feedback):*
These were proposed but Craig stopped before reviewing:
1. Ruthless prioritization (V2MOM guides triage)
2. Profile before optimizing (build observability first)
3. Test-driven development (tests enable confident refactoring)
4. Ship > Research (execute existing specs before exploring new)
5. Weekly triage ritual (review todos, cancel stale, keep < 20 active)
6. Measure metrics (track startup, agenda, test coverage, todo count)
7. Extract packages (when custom code grows: chime, org-msg pattern)
8. Incremental execution (ship small, test, iterate)

*Questions to Ask Craig When Resuming:*
- Which methods do you already do consistently?
- Which do you want to do but don't yet?
- Am I missing any important methods?

*After Methods/Obstacles/Metrics Complete:*
Then move to triage todo.org using completed V2MOM as filter.

*Key Files Modified This Session:*
- [[file:emacs-config-v2mom.org][emacs-config-v2mom.org]] - Main working document (60% complete)
- [[file:values-comparison.org][values-comparison.org]] - Analysis doc (reference only)
- [[file:SESSION-HANDOFF-ACTIVE-PROJECT.org][SESSION-HANDOFF-ACTIVE-PROJECT.org]] - This file

*Next Session Starts With:*
1. Read this handoff document
2. Read emacs-config-v2mom.org to see what's complete
3. Ask Craig: "Ready to continue V2MOM with Methods section?"
4. Show Craig the draft Methods list
5. Get feedback and complete Methods
6. Move to Obstacles
7. Move to Metrics
8. Finalize V2MOM
9. Then triage todo.org
