#+TITLE: Creating a V2MOM Strategic Framework
#+AUTHOR: Craig Jennings & Claude
#+DATE: 2025-11-05

* Overview

This session creates a V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Metrics) strategic framework for any project or goal. V2MOM provides clarity for decision-making, ruthless prioritization, and measuring progress. It transforms vague intentions into concrete action plans.

The framework originated at Salesforce and works for any domain: personal projects, business strategy, health goals, financial planning, software development, or life planning.

* Problem We're Solving

Without a strategic framework, projects suffer from:

** Unclear Direction
- "Get healthier" or "improve my finances" is too vague to act on
- Every idea feels equally important
- No principled way to say "no" to distractions
- Difficult to know what to work on next

** Priority Inflation
- Everything feels urgent or important
- Research and planning without execution
- Hard to distinguish signal from noise
- Active todo list grows beyond manageability

** No Decision Framework
- When faced with choice between A and B, no principled way to decide
- Debates about approach waste time
- Second-guessing decisions after making them
- Perfectionism masquerading as thoroughness

** Unmeasurable Progress
- Can't tell if work is actually making things better
- No objective way to know when you're "done"
- Metrics are either absent or vanity metrics
- Difficult to celebrate wins or identify blockers

*Impact:* Unfocused work, slow progress, frustration, and the nagging feeling that you're always working on the wrong thing.

* Exit Criteria

The V2MOM is complete when:

1. **All 5 sections are filled with concrete content:**
   - Vision: Clear, aspirational picture of success
   - Values: 2-4 principles that guide decisions
   - Methods: 4-7 concrete approaches with specific actions
   - Obstacles: Honest personal/technical challenges
   - Metrics: Measurable outcomes (not vanity metrics)

2. **You can use it for decision-making:**
   - Can answer "does X fit this V2MOM?" quickly
   - Provides clarity on priorities (Method 1 > Method 2 > etc.)
   - Identifies what NOT to do

3. **Both parties agree it's ready:**
   - Feels complete, not rushed
   - Actionable enough to start execution
   - Honest about obstacles (not sugar-coated)

*Measurable validation:*
- Can you articulate the vision in one sentence?
- Do the values help you say "no" to things?
- Are methods ordered by priority?
- Can you immediately identify 3-5 tasks from Method 1?
- Do metrics tell you if you're succeeding?

* When to Use This Session

Trigger this V2MOM creation workflow when:

- Starting a significant project (new business, new habit, new system)
- Existing project has accumulated many competing priorities without clear focus
- You find yourself constantly context-switching between ideas
- Someone asks "what are you trying to accomplish?" and answer is vague
- You want to apply ruthless prioritization but lack framework
- Annual/quarterly planning for ongoing projects or life goals

*V2MOM is particularly valuable for:*
- Personal infrastructure projects (tooling, systems, workflows)
- Health and fitness goals
- Financial planning and wealth building
- Software package development
- Business strategy
- Career development
- Any long-running project where you're making the decisions

* Approach: How We Work Together

** Phase 1: Understand the V2MOM Framework

Before starting, ensure both parties understand what each section means:

- *Vision:* What you want to achieve (aspirational, clear picture of success)
- *Values:* Principles that guide decisions (2-4 values, defined concretely)
- *Methods:* How you'll achieve the vision (4-7 approaches, ordered by priority)
- *Obstacles:* What's in your way (honest, personal, specific)
- *Metrics:* How you'll measure success (objective, not vanity metrics)

*Important:* V2MOM sections are completed IN ORDER. Vision informs Values. Values inform Methods. Methods reveal Obstacles. Everything together defines Metrics.

** Phase 2: Create the Document Structure

1. Create file: =docs/[project-name]-v2mom.org= or appropriate location
2. Add metadata: #+TITLE, #+AUTHOR, #+DATE, #+FILETAGS
3. Create section headings for all 5 components
4. Add "What is V2MOM?" overview section at top

*Save incrementally:* V2MOM discussions can be lengthy. Save after completing each section to prevent data loss.

** Phase 3: Define the Vision

*Ask:* "What do you want to achieve? What does success look like?"

*Goal:* Get a clear, aspirational picture. Should be 1-3 paragraphs describing the end state.

*Claude's role:*
- Help articulate what's described
- Push for specificity ("works great" → what specifically works?)
- Identify scope (what's included, what's explicitly out of scope)
- Capture concrete examples mentioned

*Good vision characteristics:*
- Paints a picture you can visualize
- Describes outcomes, not implementation
- Aspirational but grounded in reality
- Specific enough to know what's included

*Examples across domains:*
- Health: "Wake up with energy, complete a 5K without stopping, feel strong in daily activities, and have stable mood throughout the day"
- Finance: "Six months emergency fund, debt-free except mortgage, automatic retirement savings, and financial decisions that don't cause anxiety"
- Software: "A package that integrates seamlessly, has comprehensive documentation, handles edge cases gracefully, and maintainers of other packages want to depend on"

*Time estimate:* 15-30 minutes if vision is mostly clear; 45-60 minutes if needs exploration

** Phase 4: Define the Values

*Ask:* "What principles guide your decisions? When faced with choice A vs B, what values help you decide?"

*Goal:* Identify 2-4 values with concrete definitions and examples.

*Claude's role:*
- Suggest values based on vision discussion
- Push for concrete definitions (not just the word, but what it MEANS)
- Help distinguish between overlapping values
- Identify when examples contradict stated values

*Common pitfall:* Listing generic words without defining them.
- Bad: "Quality, Speed, Innovation"
- Good: "Sustainable means can maintain this for 10+ years without burning out. No crash diets, no 80-hour weeks, no technical debt I can't service."

*For each value, capture:*
1. **The value name** (1-2 words)
2. **Definition** (what this means in context of this project)
3. **Concrete examples** (how this manifests)
4. **What breaks this value** (anti-patterns)

*Method:*
- Start with 3-5 candidate values
- For each one, ask: "What does [value] mean to you in this context?"
- Discuss until definition is concrete
- Write definition with examples
- Refine/merge/remove until 2-4 remain

*Examples across domains:*
- Health V2MOM: "Sustainable: Can do this at 80 years old. No extreme diets. Focus on habits that compound over decades."
- Finance V2MOM: "Automatic: Set up once, runs forever. Don't rely on willpower for recurring decisions. Automate savings and investments."
- Software V2MOM: "Boring: Use proven patterns. No clever code. Maintainable by intermediate developers. Boring is reliable."

*Time estimate:* 30-45 minutes

** Phase 5: Define the Methods

*Ask:* "How will you achieve the vision? What approaches will you take?"

*Goal:* Identify 4-7 methods (concrete approaches) ordered by priority.

*Claude's role:*
- Extract methods from vision and values discussion
- Help order by priority (what must happen first?)
- Ensure methods are actionable (not just categories)
- Push for concrete actions under each method
- Watch for method ordering that creates dependencies

*Structure for each method:*
1. **Method name** (verb phrase: "Build X", "Eliminate Y", "Establish Z")
2. **Aspirational description** (1-2 sentences: why this matters)
3. **Concrete actions** (bulleted list: specific things to do)

*Method ordering matters:*
- Method 1 should be highest priority (blocking everything else)
- Lower-numbered methods should enable higher-numbered ones
- Common patterns:
  - Fix → Stabilize → Build → Enhance → Sustain
  - Eliminate → Replace → Optimize → Automate → Maintain
  - Learn → Practice → Apply → Teach → Systematize

*Examples across domains:*

Health V2MOM:
- Method 1: Eliminate Daily Energy Drains (fix sleep, reduce inflammatory foods, address vitamin deficiencies)
- Method 2: Build Baseline Strength (3x/week resistance training, progressive overload, focus on compound movements)
- Method 3: Establish Sustainable Nutrition (meal prep system, protein targets, vegetable servings)

Finance V2MOM:
- Method 1: Stop the Bleeding (identify and eliminate wasteful subscriptions, high-interest debt, impulse purchases)
- Method 2: Build the Safety Net (automate savings, reach $1000 emergency fund, then 3 months expenses)
- Method 3: Invest for the Future (max employer 401k match, open IRA, set automatic contributions)

Software Package V2MOM:
- Method 1: Nail the Core Use Case (solve one problem extremely well, clear documentation, handles errors gracefully)
- Method 2: Ensure Quality and Stability (comprehensive test suite, CI/CD, semantic versioning)
- Method 3: Build Community and Documentation (contribution guide, examples, responsive to issues)

*Important:* Each method should have 3-8 concrete actions listed. If you can't list concrete actions, the method is too vague.

*Time estimate:* 45-90 minutes (longest section)

** Phase 6: Identify the Obstacles

*Ask:* "What's in your way? What makes this hard?"

*Goal:* Honest, specific obstacles (both personal and technical/external).

*Claude's role:*
- Encourage honesty (obstacles are not failures, they're reality)
- Help distinguish between symptoms and root causes
- Identify patterns in behavior that create obstacles
- Acknowledge challenges without judgment

*Good obstacle characteristics:*
- Honest about personal patterns
- Specific, not generic
- Acknowledges both internal and external obstacles
- States real stakes (not just "might happen")

*Common obstacle categories:*
- Personal: perfectionism, hard to say no, gets bored, procrastinates
- Knowledge: missing skills, unclear how to proceed, need to learn
- External: limited time, limited budget, competing priorities
- Systemic: environmental constraints, lack of tools, dependencies on others

*For each obstacle:*
- Name it clearly
- Describe how it manifests in this project
- Acknowledge the stakes (what happens because of this obstacle)

*Examples across domains:*

Health V2MOM obstacles:
- "I get excited about new workout programs and switch before seeing results (pattern: 6 weeks into a program)"
- "Social events involve food and alcohol - saying no feels awkward and isolating"
- "When stressed at work, I skip workouts and eat convenient junk food"

Finance V2MOM obstacles:
- "Viewing budget as restriction rather than freedom - triggers rebellion and impulse spending"
- "Fear of missing out on lifestyle experiences my peers have"
- "Limited financial literacy - don't understand investing beyond 'put money in account'"

Software Package V2MOM obstacles:
- "Perfectionism delays releases - always 'one more feature' before v1.0"
- "Maintaining documentation feels boring compared to writing features"
- "Limited time (2-4 hours/week) and competing projects"

*Time estimate:* 15-30 minutes

** Phase 7: Define the Metrics

*Ask:* "How will you measure success? What numbers tell you if this is working?"

*Goal:* 5-10 metrics that are objective, measurable, and aligned with vision/values.

*Claude's role:*
- Suggest metrics based on vision, values, and methods
- Push for measurable numbers (not "better", but concrete targets)
- Identify vanity metrics (look good but don't measure real progress)
- Ensure metrics align with values and methods

*Metric categories:*
- **Performance metrics:** Measurable outcomes of the work
- **Discipline metrics:** Process adherence, consistency, focus
- **Quality metrics:** Standards maintained, sustainability indicators

*Good metric characteristics:*
- Objective (not subjective opinion)
- Measurable (can actually collect the data)
- Actionable (can change behavior to improve it)
- Aligned with values and methods

*For each metric:*
- Name it clearly
- Specify current state (if known)
- Specify target state
- Describe how to measure it
- Specify measurement frequency

*Examples across domains:*

Health V2MOM metrics:
- Resting heart rate: 70 bpm → 60 bpm (measure: daily via fitness tracker)
- Workout consistency: 3x/week strength training for 12 consecutive weeks
- Sleep quality: 7+ hours per night 6+ nights per week (measure: sleep tracker)
- Energy rating: subjective 1-10 scale, target 7+ average over week

Finance V2MOM metrics:
- Emergency fund: $0 → $6000 (measure: monthly)
- High-interest debt: $8000 → $0 (measure: monthly)
- Savings rate: 5% → 20% of gross income (measure: monthly)
- Financial anxiety: weekly check-in, target "comfortable with financial decisions"

Software Package V2MOM metrics:
- Test coverage: 0% → 80% (measure: coverage tool)
- Issue response time: median < 48 hours (measure: GitHub stats)
- Documentation completeness: all public APIs documented with examples
- Adoption: 10+ GitHub stars, 3+ projects depending on it

*Time estimate:* 20-30 minutes

** Phase 8: Review and Refine

Once all sections are complete, review the whole V2MOM together:

*Ask together:*
1. **Does the vision excite you?** (If not, why not? What's missing?)
2. **Do the values guide decisions?** (Can you use them to say no to things?)
3. **Are the methods ordered by priority?** (Is Method 1 truly most important?)
4. **Are the obstacles honest?** (Or are you sugar-coating?)
5. **Will the metrics tell you if you're succeeding?** (Or are they vanity metrics?)
6. **Does this V2MOM make you want to DO THE WORK?** (If not, something is wrong)

*Refinement:*
- Merge overlapping methods
- Reorder methods if priorities are wrong
- Add missing concrete actions
- Strengthen weak definitions
- Remove fluff

*Red flags:*
- Vision doesn't excite you → Need to dig deeper into what you really want
- Values are generic → Need concrete definitions and examples
- Methods have no concrete actions → Too vague, need specifics
- Obstacles are all external → Need honesty about personal patterns
- Metrics are subjective → Need objective measurements

** Phase 9: Commit and Use

Once the V2MOM feels complete:

1. **Save the document** in appropriate location
2. **Share with stakeholders** (if applicable)
3. **Use it immediately** (start Method 1 execution or first triage)
4. **Schedule first review** (1 week out: is this working?)

*Why use immediately:* Validates the V2MOM is practical, not theoretical. Execution reveals gaps that discussion misses.

* Principles to Follow

** Honesty Over Aspiration

V2MOM requires brutal honesty, especially in Obstacles section.

*Examples:*
- "I get bored after 6 weeks" (honest) vs "Maintaining focus is challenging" (bland)
- "I have 3 hours per week max" (honest) vs "Time is limited" (vague)
- "I impulse-spend when stressed" (honest) vs "Budget adherence needs work" (passive)

**Honesty enables solutions.** If you can't name the obstacle, you can't overcome it.

** Concrete Over Abstract

Every section should have concrete examples and definitions.

*Bad:*
- Vision: "Be successful"
- Values: "Quality, Speed, Innovation"
- Methods: "Improve things"
- Metrics: "Do better"

*Good:*
- Vision: "Complete a 5K in under 30 minutes, have energy to play with kids after work, sleep 7+ hours consistently"
- Values: "Sustainable: Can maintain for 10+ years. No crash diets, no injury-risking overtraining."
- Methods: "Method 1: Fix sleep quality (blackout curtains, consistent bedtime, no screens 1hr before bed)"
- Metrics: "5K time: current 38min → target 29min (measure: monthly timed run)"

** Priority Ordering is Strategic

Method ordering determines what happens first. Get it wrong and you'll waste effort.

*Common patterns:*
- **Fix → Build → Enhance → Sustain** (eliminate problems before building)
- **Eliminate → Replace → Optimize** (stop damage before improving)
- **Learn → Practice → Apply → Teach** (build skill progressively)

*Why Method 1 must address the blocker:*
- If foundation is broken, can't build on it
- High-impact quick wins build momentum
- Must stop the bleeding before starting rehab

** Methods Need Concrete Actions

If you can't list 3-8 concrete actions for a method, it's too vague.

*Test:* Can you start working on Method 1 immediately after completing the V2MOM?

If answer is "I need to think about what to do first", the method needs more concrete actions.

*Example:*
- Too vague: "Method 1: Improve health"
- Concrete: "Method 1: Fix sleep quality → blackout curtains, consistent 10pm bedtime, no screens after 9pm, magnesium supplement, sleep tracking"

** Metrics Must Be Measurable

"Better" is not a metric. "Bench press 135 lbs" is a metric.

*For each metric, you must be able to answer:*
1. How do I measure this? (exact method or tool)
2. What's the current state?
3. What's the target state?
4. How often do I measure it?
5. What does this metric actually tell me?

If you can't answer these, it's not a metric yet.

** V2MOM is Living Document

V2MOM is not set in stone. As you execute:

- Methods may need reordering (new information reveals priorities)
- Metrics may need adjustment (too aggressive or too conservative)
- New obstacles emerge (capture them)
- Values get refined (concrete examples clarify definitions)

*Update the V2MOM when:*
- Major priority shift occurs
- New obstacle emerges that changes approach
- Metric targets prove unrealistic or too easy
- Method completion opens new possibilities
- Quarterly review reveals misalignment

*But don't update frivolously:* Changing the V2MOM every week defeats the purpose. Update when major shifts occur, not when minor tactics change.

** Use It or Lose It

V2MOM only works if you use it for decisions.

*Use it for:*
- Weekly reviews (am I working on right things?)
- Priority decisions (which method does this serve?)
- Saying no to distractions (not in the methods)
- Celebrating wins (shipped Method 1 items!)
- Identifying blockers (obstacles getting worse?)

*If 2 weeks pass without referencing the V2MOM, something is wrong.* Either the V2MOM isn't serving you, or you're not using it.

* Living Document

This is a living document. After creating V2MOMs for different projects, consider:
- Did the process work well?
- Were any sections harder than expected?
- Did we discover better questions to ask?
- Should sections be created in different order?
- What patterns emerge across different domains?

Update this session document with learnings to make future V2MOM creation smoother.

* Examples: V2MOMs Across Different Domains

** Example 1: Health and Fitness V2MOM (Brief)

*Vision:* Wake up with energy, complete 5K comfortably, feel strong in daily activities, stable mood, no afternoon crashes.

*Values:*
- Sustainable: Can do this at 80 years old
- Compound: Small daily habits over quick fixes

*Methods:*
1. Fix Sleep Quality (blackout curtains, consistent bedtime, track metrics)
2. Build Baseline Strength (3x/week, compound movements, progressive overload)
3. Establish Nutrition System (meal prep, protein targets, hydration)

*Obstacles:*
- Get excited about new programs, switch before results (6-week pattern)
- Social events involve alcohol and junk food
- Skip workouts when stressed at work

*Metrics:*
- Resting heart rate: 70 → 60 bpm
- Workout consistency: 3x/week for 12 consecutive weeks
- 5K time: 38min → 29min

** Example 2: Financial Independence V2MOM (Brief)

*Vision:* Six months emergency fund, debt-free except mortgage, automatic investing, financial decisions without anxiety.

*Values:*
- Automatic: Set up once, runs forever (don't rely on willpower)
- Freedom: Budget enables choices, not restricts them

*Methods:*
1. Stop the Bleeding (eliminate subscriptions, high-interest debt, impulse purchases)
2. Build Safety Net ($1000 emergency fund → 3 months → 6 months)
3. Automate Investing (max 401k match, IRA, automatic contributions)

*Obstacles:*
- View budget as restriction → triggers rebellion spending
- FOMO on experiences peers have
- Limited financial literacy

*Metrics:*
- Emergency fund: $0 → $6000
- Savings rate: 5% → 20%
- High-interest debt: $8000 → $0

** Example 3: Emacs Configuration V2MOM (Detailed)

This V2MOM was created over 2 sessions in late 2025 and led to significant improvements in config quality and maintainability.

*** The Context

Craig's Emacs configuration had grown to ~50+ todo items, unclear priorities, and performance issues. Config was his most-used software (email, calendar, tasks, programming, reading, music) so breakage blocked all work.

*** The Process (2 Sessions, ~2.5 Hours Total)

*Session 1 (2025-10-30, ~1 hour):*
- Vision: Already clear from existing draft, kept as-is
- Values: Deep Q&A to define "Intuitive", "Fast", "Simple"
  - Each value got concrete definition + examples + anti-patterns
  - Intuitive: muscle memory + mnemonics + which-key timing
  - Fast: < 3s startup, org-agenda is THE BOTTLENECK
  - Simple: production practices, simplicity produces reliability

*Session 2 (2025-10-31, ~1.5 hours):*
- Methods: Identified 6 methods through Q&A
  - Method 1: Make Using Emacs Frictionless (fix daily pain)
  - Method 2: Stop Problems Before They Appear (stability)
  - Method 3: Make Fixing Emacs Frictionless (tooling)
  - Method 4: Contribute to Ecosystem (package maintenance)
  - Method 5: Be Kind To Future Self (new features)
  - Method 6: Develop Disciplined Practices (meta-method)
- Obstacles: Honest personal patterns
  - "Getting irritated at mistakes and pushing on"
  - "Hard to say no to fun ideas"
  - "Perfectionism delays shipping"
- Metrics: Measurable outcomes
  - Startup time: 6.2s → < 3s
  - Org-agenda rebuild: 30s → < 5s
  - Active todos: 50+ → < 20
  - Weekly triage consistency
  - Research:shipped ratio > 1:1

*** Immediate Impact

After completing V2MOM:
- Ruthlessly triaged 50 todos → 23 (under < 20 target)
- Archived items not serving vision to someday-maybe.org
- Immediate execution: removed network check (2s improvement!)
- Clear decision framework for weekly inbox triage
- Startup improved: 6.19s → 4.16s → 3.8s (approaching target)

*** Key Learnings

1. **Vision was easy:** Already had clear picture of success
2. **Values took work:** Required concrete definitions, not just words
3. **Methods needed ordering:** Priority emerged from dependency discussion
4. **Obstacles required honesty:** Hardest to name personal patterns
5. **Metrics aligned with values:** "Fast" value → fast metrics (startup, org-agenda)

*** Why It Worked

- V2MOM provided framework to say "no" ruthlessly
- Method ordering prevented building on broken foundation
- Metrics were objective (seconds, counts) not subjective
- Obstacles acknowledged personal patterns enabling better strategies
- Used immediately for inbox triage (validated practicality)

* Conclusion

Creating a V2MOM transforms vague intentions into concrete strategy. It provides:

- **Clarity** on what you're actually trying to achieve
- **Decision framework** for ruthless prioritization
- **Measurable progress** through objective metrics
- **Honest obstacles** that can be addressed
- **Ordered methods** that build on each other

**The framework takes 2-3 hours to create. It saves weeks of unfocused work.**

The V2MOM works across domains because the structure is universal:
- Vision: Where am I going?
- Values: What principles guide me?
- Methods: How do I get there?
- Obstacles: What's in my way?
- Metrics: How do I know it's working?

*Remember:* V2MOM is a tool, not a trophy. Create it, use it, update it, and let it guide your work. If you're not using it weekly, either fix the V2MOM or admit you don't need one.

*Final test:* Can you say "no" to something you would have said "yes" to before? If so, the V2MOM is working.
