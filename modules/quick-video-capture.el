;;; quick-video-capture.el --- Video Capturing with Org Capture -*- coding: utf-8; lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a seamless "fire-and-forget" workflow for downloading
;; videos from the browser to your local system using yt-dlp and task-spooler.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Browser bookmarklet integration via org-protocol
;; - Automatic queueing of downloads through task-spooler
;; - Works with any yt-dlp supported site
;; - Can be triggered manually via org-capture with URL prompt
;;
;; Setup:
;; 1. Load this file - it will auto-initialize after Emacs startup
;; 2. Add the bookmarklet from `cj/video-download-bookmarklet' to your browser
;; 3. Click the bookmarklet on any video page to queue a download
;;
;; Alternatively, trigger manually with C-c c v and enter a URL

;;; Commentary for bookmarklet:
;;
;; To use the browser bookmarklet, add this JavaScript as a bookmark URL:

;;
;; This will send the current page URL to Emacs via org-protocol, triggering
;; the download through yt-dlp and task-spooler.
