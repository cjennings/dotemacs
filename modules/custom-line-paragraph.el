;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides line and paragraph manipulation utilities.
;; These utilities enhance text editing and formatting capabilities.
;;
;; Functions include:
;; - joining lines in a region or the current line with the previous one
;; - joining entire paragraphs into single lines
;; - duplicating lines or regions (with optional commenting)
;; - removing duplicate lines
;; - removing lines containing specific text
;; - underlining text with a custom character
;;
;; Bound to keymap prefix ~C-; l
