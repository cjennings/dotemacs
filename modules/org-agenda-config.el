;;  "We are what we repeatedly do.
;;   Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit"
;;                        -- Aristotle
;;
;;  "...watch your actions, they become habits;

;; f8   - MAIN AGENDA which organizes all tasks and events into:
;;        - all unfinished priority A tasks
;;        - the weekly schedule, including the habit consistency graph
;;        - all priority B tasks
;;
;; C-f8 - TASK LIST containing all tasks from all agenda targets.
;;
;; M-f8 - TASK LIST containing all tasks from just the current org-mode buffer.
;;
;; NOTE:
;; Files that contain information relevant to the agenda will be found in the
;; following places: the schedule-file, org-roam notes tagged as 'Projects' and
;; project todo.org files found in project-dir and code-dir.
