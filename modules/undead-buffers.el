;;; undead-buffers.el --- Bury Rather Than Kill These Buffers -*- lexical-binding: t; coding: utf-8; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library allows for “burying” selected buffers instead of killing them.
;; Since they won't be killed, I'm calling them "undead buffers".
;; The main function cj/kill-buffer-or-bury-alive replaces kill-buffer.
;;
;; Additional helper commands and key bindings:
;;  - M-C (=cj/kill-buffer-and-window=): delete this window and bury/kill its buffer.
;;  - M-O (=cj/kill-other-window=): delete the next window and bury/kill its buffer.
;;  - M-M (=cj/kill-all-other-buffers-and-windows=): kill or bury all buffers except
;;    the current one and delete all other windows.
;;
;; Add to the list of "undead buffers" by adding to the cj/buffer-bury-alive-list
;; variable.
