;; author Craig Jennings <c@cjennings.net>

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides a simple, end-userâ€“focused interface for
;; creating, naming, saving, and replaying keyboard macros in Emacs.
;; All commands are built on top of the built-in =kmacro= machinery, but
;; add a lightweight workflow and persistence across sessions.
;;
;; Workflow:
;;
;; 1. Start recording with C-F3 (or M-x cj/kbd-macro-start-or-end)
;;    This toggles macro recording on.
;;    Now you can perform all the edits you want recorded in the macro.
;;
;; 2. Stop recording with C-F3 (or M-x cj/kbd-macro-start-or-end)
;;    This stops recording and the macro becomes the "last keyboard macro."
;;
;; 3. Replay your macro <f3> (or M-x call-last-kbd-macro)
;;
;; 4. Name your macro with M-<F3>
;;    You will be prompted for a short name (e.g. =align-comments=,
;;    =cleanup-trail-spaces=).  This name is how you'll refer to it later.
;;
;; 5. Recall that macro later with M-x [the name you gave the macro]
;;
;; 6. View all your saved macros with s-<f3> (super-f3)
;;
;; 7. All macros reload at startup automatically.
;;    When this library is loaded, it will look for the save file and
;;    re-establish all your named macros in your current session.
