# Wrap Up Session

When the user says "let's wrap it up", "that's a wrap", or "let's call it a wrap", execute this complete workflow:

## 1. Write Session Notes
Add anything important to `docs/NOTES.org` for next session:
- Key decisions made
- Work completed
- Context needed for continuation
- Any pending issues or blockers

## 2. Commit and Push Changes
- Run `git status` to see what changed
- Run `git diff` to review changes
- Create a descriptive commit message following repository conventions
- Commit with co-author attribution (Claude)
- Push to ALL remotes (origin + github)

## 3. Valediction
Give a friendly goodbye with:
- Brief summary of what was accomplished
- What's ready for next session
- Any important reminders

Execute this workflow now.
